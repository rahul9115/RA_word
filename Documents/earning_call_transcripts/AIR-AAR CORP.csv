Operator:
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by John Holmes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements. Accordingly, these statements are no guarantee of future performance. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in the company's earnings release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. Certain non-GAAP financial information will be discussed on the call today. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is set forth in the company's earnings release. A replay of this conference call will be available for on-demand listening shortly after the completion of the call on AAR's website. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2024 results. This was a very strong start to the year and I’m both encouraged by our sustained momentum and proud of our team for continuing to deliver. Specifically, sales for the quarter were up 23% year-over-year from $446 million to $559 million. Sales to commercial customers increased 34% and sales to government customers increased 3%. Within Parts Supply, sales were up 40% over the prior year quarter as we monetize USM investments that we made over the last year and as recent distribution wins continued to mature. Regarding USM, even though supply remains tight, our global sourcing team continues to secure high demand material. New parts distribution saw continued growth in our commercial product line which more than offsets lower parts sales to the U.S government. In repair and engineering, sales were up 8% over the prior year quarter driven by continued strength in our hangars, partially offset by a slowdown in our landing gear operation due to the repair cycle timing of certain gear types. In integrated solution, sales were up 22% over the prior year quarter due to increased flight hours in our power-by-the-hour program, the contribution from track and the strength in our government programs. Notably our F-16 program in Europe is still in the process of ramping up and will become a more meaningful contributor as the year progresses. Turning to profitability, our adjusted operating margin was 7.3%, up from 6.9% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating margins expanded in all of our segments except expeditionary and this represents our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 28% from $0.61 per share to a first quarter record of $0.78 per share. With respect to cash, as we indicated in last quarter's call, we saw attractive opportunities to invest in our Parts Supply segment in the quarter, which drove a use of cash in operating activities from continuing operations of $18.5 million. Specifically, we made a net inventory investment of $38 million in our Parts Supply segment to support both USM demand and our recent distribution wins. It is worth noting that our prior parts supply investments are what drove the growth and profitability in this quarter and we expect strong results from these most recent investments over time as well. Even after these growth investments, our net leverage at quarter end was only 1.1 -- 1.18x adjusted EBITDA, and as such, our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong. Before I discuss new business, I would like to comment on the recent news regarding a parts supplier that allegedly provided uncertified parts using forged paperwork for use in CFM engine repairs. AAR [indiscernible] purchase and were sold any parts from this supplier. Since our founding nearly 70 years ago, we have been exceptionally focused on quality and safety and conduct the highest level of diligence when we source parts. This incident highlights the value of our quality system, and we believe that will result in customers placing even greater emphasis on AAR's reputation for doing it right. Now turning to new business. During the quarter, we announced two multiyear commercial agreements with Moog, one for distribution and one for reciprocal component repair services. Importantly, these agreements are first steps in a new strategic relationship with Moog that we expect will lead to new opportunities. In addition, subsequent to the quarter, we announced an exclusive multiyear agreement with Pall Corporation, a Danaher Company to distribute highly engineered filtration products to foreign military customers. This agreement recognizes the extended customer reach that AAR provides to our partners, as well as the investments that we have made in recent years to augment our foreign military sales capability and our compliance programs. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Sean Gillen, to discuss the results in more detail.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $549.7 million were up 23.2% year-over-year. Our commercial sales were up 33.7% driven by growth across our commercial activities, particularly parts supply. And our government sales were up 2.9% due primarily to integrated solutions, partially offset by declines for new parts distribution in part supply and expeditionary. Gross profit margin in the quarter was 18.4%, consistent with the prior year quarter on a reported basis, and up from 18.1% in the prior year quarter on an adjusted basis. Gross profit margin in our commercial business was 19.3% and gross profit margin in our government business was 16.3%. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $74.7 million, which included the $11.2 million charge we announced last week associated with the Russian court judgment, and $2.8 million from Trax acquisition and amortization expenses as well as increased investments in the business. In the Russian judgment, a court directed us to make a payment equal to the allegedly fair value of aircraft engines we purchased from a Russian airline in 2016 and 2017. We strongly disagree with the Russian court judgment and as noted in our September 22 8-K believe the judgment is the result of among other things, a hostile business and legal environment for foreign companies in Russia. Additionally, we believe we have strong defenses to any attempt that may be made to recognize and enforce the adverse judgment. Excluding discharge to Trax expenses and $1.1 million of compliance costs, SG&A was $59.6 million or 10.8% of sales. As we announced last month, we entered into an agreement during the quarter to effectively transfer our pension obligations and assets to an insurance company. This transaction allowed us to fully secure the funding for plan participants and eliminate our plan management activities and associated funding risk going forward. Due to the plans funding status, no additional contributions were required as part of the transfer. And in fact, there was a surplus funding of $7.6 million, which we expect to use to fund certain 401(k) contributions. In conjunction with this transaction, we recognized a noncash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $27 million in the quarter. We are very proud to be able to deliver on the commitments we made to plan participants, and have concluded our activities associated with the U.S pension plan. Net interest expense for the quarter was $5.4 million compared to $1 million last year, driven by higher interest rates and borrowings. Regarding our effective tax rate, we expect it to be approximately 27% for the balance of the year. Cash flow used in operating activities from continuing operations was $18.5 million. As John indicated, this usage was driven by net inventory investment of $37.9 million in our Parts Supply segment to support both USM and new parts distribution demand. Specifically, these investments included a variety of engine platforms for USM material, and inventory to support certain recently awarded distribution lines. We expect these investments to continue to generate a strong return on invested capital going forward. Even after the investments our net leverage remains low at 1.18x adjusted EBITDA. We are continuing to see both robust demand for aftermarket parts and attractive opportunities for further investments in parts supply. That said, we expect to generate slightly positive cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter. Thank you for your attention, and I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you Sean. Over the last few years, we've been proud of our ability to operate successfully in a particularly dynamic environment and the environment certainly remains dynamic today. While we expect the global aviation industry and our major customers to continue to grow, some low cost and regional carriers have cited a slowing of demand and fuel prices and inflation that remain watch out for the industry. At the same time, new aircraft delivery constraints and the ongoing GTF issues mean that the current fleet will continue to operate longer, which overall directly benefits AAR. Therefore, on balance, we expect continued strong demand for our parts and services. For our parts activities, while USM supply remains constrained due to the factors I just mentioned, we're still seeing attractive opportunities to invest and we expect that over time as new aircraft and engines are ultimately delivered, the availability of USM supply will gradually improve. In Repair and Engineering, our hangars are expected to remain largely full for the foreseeable future. Our Miami hangar expansion is progressing and we continue to evaluate expansion at other hangars where we can partner with local government, leverages existing overhead, expand our customer commitments and readily access labor. On the government side, as you know, there is a possibility of a shutdown. If that occurs, our current expectation is that it would not significantly impact our integrated solutions business given we operate under previously awarded contracts. It may have some impact on our government distribution operations in terms of payment timing, orders and shipments. In any event, the situation is fluid, and we plan to remain flexible so that we can take action as needed to mitigate any impacts. All that said, in general, we see a constrained budgetary environment as supportive of our efficient commercial best practices offerings to our government customers. Looking forward with respect to Q2 overall, assuming no extended government shutdown, we expect both year-over-year and sequential sales and earnings growth. Specifically, we anticipate mid to high teens year-over-year sales growth with operating margins similar to or better than what we delivered in Q2 of last year. More generally, we are encouraged by the demand signals we are receiving from our primary customers. And this, combined with the industry's continued reliance on current generation aircraft, creates a very favorable operating environment. At our government business as we win new contract and the focus shifts to fleet readiness, we expect to accelerate our growth trajectory. Again, we are encouraged by our very strong start to the year and look forward to continuing to invest in our business and our people to drive further growth. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
Hey, good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hey, Rob. How are you?
Robert Spingarn:
Good. Thanks. I wanted to ask you about your -- very good sales growth in the quarter and what you just talked about for next quarter and how we think about that against the 5% to 10% CAGR you're looking toward over the next few years. And maybe as a sub component to that, John, does any of this GTF situation, how does that translate for you guys?
John Holmes:
Sure. Thanks, Rob. All good questions, as usual. So as it relates to the quarter, obviously, as you can tell, we're really proud of what we delivered. It's really strong growth across the company, most notably in the parts business, and how that relates to the 5% to 7% guidance that we put out, obviously, that's a multiyear target. And as we continue to ramp up, the comps year-over-year will continue to increase. So we're thinking about years ahead. But in the immediate term, as we indicated for Q2 and the rest of this year, in particular, we expect to be above that long range target.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay.
John Holmes:
And on the GTF …
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Okay. Is there -- yes, that’s what I was …
John Holmes:
Yes, and on the GTF, I would say, anything right now that takes next gen aircraft out of service and places more emphasis on the current generation of aircraft is a positive for us. So if you've got 600 or more aircrafts that are going to be coming out for these mods [ph] over the next couple of years, that's just going to put more pressure on the existing fleet, which is our bread and butter right now. So net-net that that will likely be a positive for us. The flipside is, it's going to continue to constrain the supply for USM material. But as we’ve demonstrated last year, and this year with some of the investments we've been able to find and make, we're still -- we believe doing a good job of growing out there and finding material to support this great growth even when the supply is tight.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay, super helpful. I wanted to ask you on distribution. When we think about -- you're adding contracts, and you've been very clear that they take a couple of years to ramp, so we should expect more sales contribution from these latest ones over time. But how should we think about the margins in this business? KLX was in the mid teens before it was acquired by Boeing. On the other hand, other distributors have been a bit lower, I’m thinking of AVR. What's the right way to think about margins in this business?
John Holmes:
Yes, we'd be probably somewhere in the middle. If the margins for that business are higher than the overall margin for the company right now. So as that business continues to grow, that mix shift will be favorable. That's part of the reason you've seen the continued improvement in operating margin over the last 10 consecutive quarters. And as we've talked about, we because of our market position as the largest independent, and our balance sheet to continue to go ahead and invest in these programs, whereas our larger competitors on my Airbus and Boeing don't have [indiscernible] independence or the focus on this type of investment. Now we think it's a great opportunity for us to just continue to take share. And as that mix shift continues to head towards the parts in general, but most specifically distribution, that'll be accretive to operating margins.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay, fantastic. Just quick one, maybe this -- Sean, this is for you. But the margins in the quarter are a little bit softer than the prior quarter. And I think you'd been calling for them to be about the same. Is there anything behind that?
Sean Gillen:
Yes, and I think if you take a look at some of the segments detail, that's in the release as well as the Q that'll come out, I think margin still really strong performance, significant improvement from the prior year period. But as you mentioned, sequentially, a slight decline and a lot of that came in parts, which was relatively consistent with the prior year quarter, which is down slightly, that it's -- that's just a mix of a really strong Q4 that finish last fiscal year and then what we saw on this quarter.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay, appreciate that. Thanks for the color.
John Holmes:
Okay. Thanks, Rob.
Operator:
Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey, good evening, guys. Nice results. Thanks for taking the question.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Michael Ciarmoli:
John, maybe just back to Rob's question, just looking into second quarter guidance, I think you said mid to high teens year-over-year. I don't think you said anything sequentially. I know first quarters usually seasonally weaker, but that kind of implies maybe sequentially flattish, or just up slightly. I mean, is it just -- can you give any more color on maybe how we should think about 2Q and seasonal trends if they were as present this quarter as normally?
John Holmes:
Sure. Great question. We [indiscernible] expect up slightly, sequentially. And as it relates to seasonality, we've seen this now, the coming out of COVID where, if you recall pre-COVID, we definitely would see a pretty meaningful drop from Q4 to Q1. We obviously did not see that this quarter and we're very proud of that. And it had been less severe last year than it had been in prior years. And the reason for that is we really worked with our customer base in the hangars to level [indiscernible] with the operation. And we've also continued to refine the number of customers that we work with in our hangars. But the airlines even though they want their aircraft as much as possible to be in the air during the summer, they recognize that to keep work going, to keep the workforce around, given the labor supply constraints, it's best for everybody. And so we do expect continued slight seasonality going forward, but not to the degree that we would have seen prior due to the changes I just mentioned.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe John just I think you mentioned a slowdown in landing gear. Can you maybe elaborate on that comment a bit? I don't think I caught it all.
John Holmes:
Yes, gear are on a -- and obviously our MRO businesses at hangars, which we pay a lot of attention to what's component repair, and it's landing gear, those are the three main activities obviously dominated by hangar, but those other two are meaningful as well. The landing gear business is on roughly a 10-year cycle and gear come off at intervals over their lifetime for overhaul. And we are coming kind of on the other end of what had been a pretty significant overhaul cycle for the customers that we serve. So that business is in a forecast -- is in a bit of a decline right now just based on the natural cycle for these overhauls. That'll last for a period of time and then it'll pick back up. But that was -- obviously some slight softness inside of repair and engineering that we wanted to highlight.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Okay. And then last one for me and I'll jump off here. Just I guess as you go out there and look for some of that new material and the parts supply, the USM, what do you see in terms of profitability? And I guess maybe that kind of leads into what is the market looking like? I mean, is it pretty active to get your hands on that material? Are you having to pay higher prices than normal? Can you kind of protect your kind of historical returns? If you would, or maybe just any color there?
John Holmes:
Yes, great question. So I would say, yes, we absolutely, for the asset types in which we are most active are paying higher prices, but we're also able to charge higher prices. So we are able to maintain our spreads. You're going to see some fluctuation as you did in this quarter in any one quarter just based on the mix of assets that we sell, whether they're whole engines or parts, et cetera, it'll move margins around a little bit. But generally speaking, the spread that we've had for years, we're able to maintain, if not grow. And once again, I just want to highlight the efforts of the team there, it is a really tight market. We're the largest in the world in terms of going out there and sourcing material. And that's one of the reasons that we're so focused on maintaining balance sheet flexibility to the extent that we have the opportunity to [indiscernible] and capital to get our hands on some great material, as we did this quarter, for example, that we're in a position to do that.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it and helpful. Thanks, guys. I'll jump back in the queue.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst:
Hey, John and Sean, congrats on the nice sales growth in the quarter. This is Keith [indiscernible] on for Ken Herbert. First wanted to just talk about the pricing in the aftermarket in what you guys are kind of seeing there. Presumably, it's going to be some strong pricing. So maybe you could just kind of walk us through that.
John Holmes:
Yes, I think similar to what I just mentioned, we are absolutely able to command strong pricing in the aftermarket. But also, particularly in the use parts business, we're having to pay higher prices, because material is in such demand. We haven't talked too much about pricing in the hangars. And as you know, the last couple of years, we've seen a pretty meaningful rise in our labor costs. But we've received great support and cooperation from our MRO customer base about making pricing adjustments, oftentimes off cycle from contract renewal period in order to make sure that we can maintain our profitability to continue to provide them great support.
Unidentified Analyst:
Sounds good. And maybe just one more for me. I think at the Investor Day, you had talked about the maturity cycle being very robust on something with the CFM56, with the [indiscernible]. With the [indiscernible] engines and the issues at Pratt for the turbofan just how do you think about shop visits in that going forward?
John Holmes:
Yes, we remain very bullish on that. The engine shops and you bring up a great point, we sell parts to airlines, but some of our biggest parts -- our biggest customers in the parts business on the engine shop themselves and we received forecasts based on their expected inputs. So over a year or longer and they are all very full for those engine types that you mentioned. And so we expect a strong demand there for some time to come.
Unidentified Analyst:
All right. Thanks so much. I will jump back in the queue.
John Holmes:
Great, thank you.
Operator:
Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Benchmark. Your line is open.
Joshua Sullivan:
Hey, good evening.
John Holmes:
Hey, Josh. How are you?
Joshua Sullivan:
I'm doing well. On the forged parts issue that's circulating through the industry here, is that -- can that be a driver for Trax? Or is there a way to leverage the Trax franchise for that?
John Holmes:
Yes, that's a great question and something we've been talking about even before this, that being able to track the providence of parts digitally, and some people have talked about blockchain or other elements to do that is definitely something that we think the industry can benefit from. And unfortunately, this [indiscernible] that's out there is highlighting that [indiscernible]. To do those things, take some time. And I would say it's currently not part of the Trax platform. But given the technological capability that we acquired and with that company, this is definitely something that we could pursue. So the short answer to your question is yes, I think that could be part of the longer term solution here. And if we think there's a market for Trax, we got the capability to make investments and go in that direction.
Joshua Sullivan:
Got it. And then question on labor, given the demand that's going to be out there for wrench turner's and to address some of the RTX [ph] issues. Are you seeing any pressure on labor rates at this point?
John Holmes:
It's been stable. We've seen it, as I mentioned for the last couple of years, but it's not at the accelerating rate that it had been before. Now we're certainly aware of that, as the airline's work to continue to negotiate their contracts with unions, et cetera. Obviously, we've been focused on pilots to the extended day, move on to mechanics and other constituencies that could create a downstream effect to our non-union team. But it would be the same dynamic that we've been dealing with for the last few years is, which is to the extent that we see an increase in our costs. We need to seek relief from our customers so that we can continue to provide the services they come to rely on.
Joshua Sullivan:
Got it. Thank you for the time.
John Holmes:
Great. Thanks, Josh.
Operator:
I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
John Holmes:
Well, we really appreciate everybody's time and interest and we look forward to being back here for the Q2 earnings call. Thank you.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good bye."

Operator:
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. We're joined today by John Holmes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, these statements are no guarantee of future performance. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in the company's earnings release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 and Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2023. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. Certain non-GAAP financial information will be discussed on the call today. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is set forth in the company's earnings release. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023 results. For the full year, sales increased 9% from $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20% from $2.38 per share to a record $2.86 per share which is driven by both sales growth and our increase in adjusted operating margin from 6.3% to 7.5%. The strong performance reflects continued execution on our strategy to leverage our improved cost structure and capture growth in higher margin activity. For the fourth quarter, sales were up 60% year-over-year, from $476 million to $553 million. Sales to commercial customers increased 31% while as expected, sales to government customers decreased 7% due primarily to the completion of certain government programs in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 7.8% up from 7% in the prior year quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 15% from $0.76 per share to a record $0.83 per share. We saw further growth in our commercial cards activities as global air travel continue to recover. In addition, as described in previous quarters, we saw engine green time availability continue to abate, which drove additional engine shop visits and associated demand for engine parts, which represent the majority of our USM offering. USM supply remains tight and our team continues to work to identify opportunities to acquire material to meet the robust demand. Further, our recent new parts distribution contract awards, continued to ramp-up. During the quarter, we did experience some delays from OEM, due to supply-chain issues, where we're working with our partners to receive the overdue material to ship against our backlog. In MRO, demand remains strong even though our hangars have been mostly for some time, we were able to drive some additional volume through our footprint in the quarter. Labor availability remains tight, but our attrition levels have stabilized and our many partnership with schools and other sources of talent, continue to serve us well. In integrated solutions, although our government work was down, we saw better performance in our commercial power-by-the-hour programs, driven by increased flying internationally and the improvements that we've made to that operation over the last few years. With respect to cash, we generated cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations of $45 million. Our net leverage at quarter-end was 1.07x EBITDA, which was down from 1.35x at the end of Q3 on a pro-forma basis for the Trax acquisition. As such, our balance sheet remains strong and we have significant flexibility to fund our continued growth. Regarding new business, we announced in March that we had agreed to acquire nine Boeing 757, 200 passenger aircraft equipped with 18 Rolls-Royce RB211 engines from American Airlines. This investment provides us with feedstock to supply used serviceable material on the RB211 engine side to the 757 cargo market which continue to be strong. It is also an example of the type of asset acquisition that our part supply team makes to support the demand for USM. In addition, I want to mention the announcement that we made yesterday regarding the expansion of our Miami airframe maintenance facility. Since making that announcement, we have received final approval from Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners for the project. Our agreement with both the Miami-Dade Aviation Department and United Airlines will increase our volume by 33% at that site. This project meets all of the criteria that we have previously outlined for MRO capacity growth, including expansion of an existing facility with government financial support, favorable local market dynamics, labor market dynamics and a long-term customer commitment. We expect to break ground in our fiscal Q2 and construction will take approximately 24 months. AAR will be reimbursed by the Miami-Dade Aviation Department and expect $50 million project cost. I would like to thank United Airlines, Miami-Dade County Mayor, Daniella Levine Cava; Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners Chairman, Oliver Gilbert; and the Miami-Dade Beacon Council for their partnership and making this important development the reality. Finally, I want to highlight that beginning with Q1 of fiscal '24, we will be separating the reporting of what is currently our Aviation Services segment into three separate segments. Parts supply, prepared engineering and integrated solutions. This operation better reflects the way we manage the company and how we view the areas of growth. It will also provide an enhanced disclosure and insight to the investment community and other stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Sean Gillen to discuss the results in more detail.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $553.3 million were up 16.2% year-over-year. Our commercial sales were up 30.7% driven by growth across our commercial activities and our government sales were down 7.1% due primarily to the completion of certain government programs in our previous fiscal year. We also saw a decline in defense distribution sales due to the timing of shipments from certain OEMs. Gross profit margin in the quarter was 19.5% versus 18.9% in the prior year quarter. Gross profit margin in our commercial business was 20% and gross profit margin in our government business was 18.5%. The strong commercial margin reflect the improved performance of our commercial integrated solutions activity that John mentioned and the contribution from Trax, which is a higher margin offering. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $70.8 million, excluding certain Trax expenses and other items that are detailed in the earnings press release. This figure was $64.1 million or 11.6% of sales. This percentage is up sequentially, but down year-over-year. In Q1, we expect a downward sequential cadence in SG&A similar to last year. Net interest expense for the quarter was $4.7 million compared to $0.6 million last year, driven by higher interest rates and borrowings. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.2% which was lower than we had anticipated due to certain state tax and other items in the quarter. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26% in Q1 of FY '24 and approximately 27% for the full year FY '24 Cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $45.3 million. We ended the quarter with net debt of 203.6 million and net leverage of 1.07x EBITDA. In light of the Trax acquisition and other attractive opportunities to invest in our business, we elected not to repurchase stock during Q4. We continue to have $58 million remaining on our stock repurchase program, and we'll evaluate both usage of the remaining authorization and expansion of the program over the remainder of this fiscal year based upon alternative capital deployment opportunities. On that note, we are seeing attractive opportunities for investment in the USM market and they elect to deploy capital in Q1, which we expect will drive a use of operating cash in the quarter. Regarding our resegmentation, we plan to file an 8-K today that provides financial results for the new segments for FY '22 on an annual basis and for FY '23 on a quarterly basis. The new parts supply segment will consist of both our used serviceable material and distribution activities. The repair and engineering segment will consist of airframe MRO, component and landing gear MRO and engineering. And the integrated solutions segment will consist of our government programs and commercial power-by-the-hour component solutions and our software solutions such as Trax and Airinmar. Our expeditionary services segment consisting of mobility systems will remain unchanged. In addition to the segment changes, we are changing our measure of segment performance from gross profit to operating income. We have frequently heard from investors and analysts on the desire for greater transparency, and we hope these changes will be well received. Thank you for your attention. And I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. Looking forward, we expect the commercial market recovery to continue. Commercial air travel remains below pre-pandemic levels by most measures and in most markets. And as you have heard from many major airlines recently, their outlook for growth remains strong. This all means that we remain optimistic about the demand for our services Specifically, we expect interest in USM to remain robust. Although supply is constrained, it has been improving, and we expect it to continue to improve as airlines take delivery of new aircraft and retirements increase. Notably, we do not expect additional USM supply to negatively impact our profitability. Instead, we believe it will lead to more growth as the availability of USM is currently a growth constraint. In distribution, we expect to win more new lines with more OEMs, which will drive more growth. The continued market recovery and OEM supply chain improvement will also provide tailwinds. In Airframe MRO, we expect our hangers will remain largely full throughout the year, and we are excited to be adding more capacity when the Miami expansion comes online. Additionally, we do have capacity available to meet growing demand in our component and land and new repair facilities. On top of that, we are also evaluating expansion at certain other of our airframe MRO locations where we have long-term customer interest and access to labor. Finally, in our government business, our F-16 program in Europe is not yet fully ramped and will be a more meaningful contributor in FY '24 and beyond. More generally, we remain confident that our value proposition in this market - our pipeline of opportunities will translate into additional growth over time. With respect to specific guidance, our operating environment remains exciting and dynamic and so we plan to continue our current practice of providing an outlook on a quarterly basis throughout our FY '24. On that note, we expect to see Q1 sales to be in - to be in the low teens year-over-year driven by our commercial businesses and adjusted operating margins similar to what we just delivered in Q4. Looking ahead, we expect another year of margin expansion, albeit at a slower rate than the last two years. As you know, we are holding an Investor Day this Thursday, in New York, and we look forward to seeing you there to discuss our growth strategy, long-term financial targets and commitment to continuing to deliver shareholder value in more detail. Before taking questions, I would like to take a moment to thank our team for delivering an outstanding year in our customers and other partners for supporting us. We continue to make our MRO operations more efficient, added several key distribution wins, expanded support of our USM customers, added an important new capability with the acquisition of Trax and extended and upsized our credit facility in a challenging market. The result has been nine consecutive quarters of adjusted operating margin improvement and record adjusted earnings while maintaining superb financial flexibility. Coming out of the pandemic this success was not inevitable and once again, I'm exceptionally proud of our team. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Pete Osterland with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Peter Osterland:
Hi, good evening. I'm on for Mike Ciarmoli. Thanks for taking our question. So first, I just wanted to ask on the Miami facility expansion. Once construction there is complete, what's the time frame for ramping up operations fully? And how many new hires will you need to add in order to support that additional capacity?
John Holmes:
Yes, great question, and thanks, for joining in on the call. Given the fact that we're expanding at an existing site where we've been operating for quite some time, once construction is complete, we expect ramp up to actually go very quickly. We anticipate hiring about 250 new people for this expansion. And again, one of the criteria for expanding in a site is that we feel we've got access to a very strong supply of labor which is certainly what we have in Miami. So we will be recruiting that talent well in advance of going live.
Peter Osterland:
All right. Very helpful. Thanks. And then I just had a follow-up on the margin outlook for the coming year. Particularly given that you had some strong year-over-year growth this quarter, but SG&A, excluding the track expenses, the margin was about flat versus the prior year. I guess just what do you need to see in order to kind of see SG&A expenses improve and start to trend closer to the target you mentioned in the past of around 10% of sales. Does that still a viable target? Or are there any dynamics going on with wage inflation or anything else that has kind of changed the math there a bit?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. I'd say store remains the target to be at 10% of sales. And I think to get there, what we'll need to see is just continued leverage on the top line on both commercial and government sales. As I mentioned, Trax is slightly higher in SG&A, but it doesn't move the needle massively to the whole company. And even in this inflationary environment, we do still think that we can get to 10% of sales as we see more leverage on the top line.
Peter Osterland:
All right. Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Kenneth Herbert:
Hi, John and Sean, nice way to end the year. I wanted to first follow up, John, on some of your comments on the USM marketplace. It sounds like you're seeing more feedstock and it clearly sounds like you've got some opportunities very near term in the first fiscal quarter. Can you provide any more sort of granularity on where you're seeing the opportunities and maybe how we should think about investments either in the first quarter or across fiscal '24, specifically in the USM area?
John Holmes:
Yes. Great question, and I appreciate you being on the call. Yes, I would say, generally speaking, we are seeing loosening in the USM supply and we have been able to deploy - we're able to deploy capital throughout our FY '23 and here is we're starting off FY '24, we're presented with some unique opportunities. And again, as you know, that's one of our big advantages in the market is when these things come up. And there's still few and far between, we're able to move quickly. With respect to commenting on specific asset, types, et cetera, I'd prefer to stay away from that, given competitive dynamics. But we have a significant focus on engines. And we are talking to all areas of market, whether that's lessors that are going through portfolio changes. Airlines that are going through fleet changes, or even other brokers in the market that have assets available that meet contracts that we have to support.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. Very helpful. And based on your comments, it sounds like as you invest and you obviously transfer some of this feedstock into USM. You're not expecting - or in fiscal '24, the guidance doesn't imply any sort of significant step down in pricing you're getting in the marketplace for the material correct? I mean, it sounds like there's still enough of an imbalance that you should be able to get price on the USM at least through the fiscal year?
John Holmes:
Yes. We definitely feel confident in maintaining our spreads throughout the year.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. Great. And if I could, just one final question. On the heavy MRO side, I mean, we continue to hear about capacity constraint and a number of maybe large captive airline operations may be getting out sort of - getting out of the heavy MRO business to some extent. So I think your capacity additions make a lot of sense in your - sounds like there's other opportunities there to maybe look to add capacity. How far out are you sold within - or how's the backlog look maybe within the heavy MRO segment? And I guess, more importantly, it seems like if there was ever an environment for you to get better labor rates, it would be right now. So can you comment on sort of what you're seeing from that standpoint?
John Holmes:
Yes. The commitment that we have from United that drove the Miami expansion and any of the other customers that we're talking to about potential other expansions, those are multiyear commitments. We're building permanent new capacity, and so we want to make sure that we align with that. We are absolutely seeing airlines because they anticipate capacity shortage for some time, being willing to sign multiyear agreements with us. So that's encouraging. As it relates to labor rates, I think we've touched on this over the last couple of calls. But generally speaking, we have a very productive dialogue with our airline customers about labor rates. And we have contract by contract work with the customers to adjust labor rates, our price to them to reflect the cost of labor that we've seen in the market. And we've been able to, in an inflationary environment, drive margin expansion in that business for maternal efficiencies, but also as a result of some of those discussions.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. And so is it fair to assume that as we get the new segmentation and we see the sort of the repair business broken out a little bit better, we should see some of that drop to your bottom line in terms of there's an area for margin expansion within that business in particular?
John Holmes:
Yes, I mean we can talk more about that on Thursday when we work together. But broadly, you have you have visibility into the margins of that business. But I would say that our focus on margin expansion is not going to come through price increases to the customer. That's really just to keep us even with the increasing labor costs. The margin expansion that we expect to getting over time is through investments in the facility. So Miami, leveraging the fixed cost structure there to have 33% more volume or deploying technology throughout our hangers, whether it's paperless drilling inspections, things like that to get ourselves more efficient inside the operation.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Look forward to Thursday.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.
Joshua Sullivan:
Hi, good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hi, Josh.
Joshua Sullivan:
Just to kind of follow-up on Ken's question there. Looking at scheduled care needs at the MRO facilities and we hear about extended turnaround times. But when you look at the market, when do you think turnaround times kind of peak?
John Holmes:
In terms of turnaround times in our own hangers, I mean we're running a pretty steady operation for the last several quarters. So we feel that we're actually operating quite efficiently in hangers. As it relates to component repair turnaround time, again, we feel good about the TAT that we've had in our own shops. We do outsource a lot of repairs, and we have seen those turnaround times increase. To say that - to try to predict when that's going to peak and come down is difficult. But I think what we're hearing, and I'm sure you're hearing the same thing from repair providers, many of them are OEMs. We feel overall that the supply chain environment is improving. And so this should be a better year than last year for turnaround times.
Joshua Sullivan:
Got it. And then maybe as far as Trax, any KPIs you can share that you've completed or you're looking to complete?
John Holmes:
Nothing specific at this point, what I would say more generally is that we're roughly a quarter into the acquisition. It's going very well. The integration is on track or ahead of our plan. The team there remains extremely excited about the possibilities between our two companies. On Thursday, we'll provide more detail on the elements of the vision that we have for the Trax AAR combination, and I feel really good about it.
Joshua Sullivan:
Great. Thank you for the time.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
Hi, guys.
John Holmes:
Hi Rob, how're you?
Robert Spingarn:
Very good. Thanks. John, I wanted to ask you just all this talk about heavy maintenance and maybe just to simplify it. Would you say with the unionization we've seen and all the traction that labor is getting in this constrained environment. Would you say that the wage spread between captive airline labor and your labor is widening?
John Holmes:
I want to look at some data on that, but based on, yes, some of the increases that you're seeing as a result of the new contract, I would say, yes.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. So this just provides additional tailwind for you?
John Holmes:
Yes. And again, we've just announced an expansion. There are other expansions that we're considering, and we're only doing that where we're getting long-term commitments from customers.
Robert Spingarn:
Right, right. And then in terms of increased rates coming out of the OEMs, Boeing and Airbus starting to get those ramps, have you seen any impact from that in your business as more aircraft come through. I understand they're nowhere near where they're going to be. I'm just curious to the extent to which you might be seeing an effect from that.
John Holmes:
I would say nothing broad or a trend at this point. The closest thing was just we are seeing a loosening of - a slight loosening of supply in the USM market. We are seeing more opportunities come up. But again, it's coming from all quarters, again, whether it's lessors like airlines, et cetera. So we assume that the slight increase in production that you're seeing out of the OEMs is driving some of the fleet movement that's providing opportunities for us to acquire assets
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then, Sean, for you, just with the parts distribution business impacting cash flows, if we were to exclude that or maybe look long term, is there a free cash flow conversion target that we should think about?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. I mean we thought about that over time as well. We've got to stay away from giving specific guidance on that, which is in terms of net working capital, as you mentioned, we'll see volatility from time to time. We'll be around new distribution agreements, which generally come with an upfront capital outlay or USM opportunities as we kind of think saw back in our Q2 time period. We saw some big opportunities that we moved more aggressively on. But outside of that, obviously very focused on overall net working capital efficiency in AAR and AP as well and continue to try to improve the cash flow profile of the company, which I think is part of the margin improvement that we've shown pre-COVID today, I think you're seeing some of that improvement on the cash flow as well.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Thanks so much. I'll save the rest for Thursday.
John Holmes:
Great. Thanks Rob.
Operator:
Thank you. Please standby for our next question. We have a follow-up question from the line of Ken Herbert. Your line is open.
Kenneth Herbert:
Hi, Sean or John, can you comment on maybe what percentage of the growth in the quarter was Trax or what that contribution was?
John Holmes:
It was very modest. It was very modest this quarter, on track with expectations, a very modest. And we would reiterate that we expect Trax to be accretive to our FY '24 numbers.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. Okay. Great. And then I'm sure we'll get into more of this on Thursday. But as you look for fiscal '24, can you comment at least at a high level on sort of expectations for revenues are sort of low double digits, a fair starting point as we think about the full year?
John Holmes:
Yes. As we mentioned, we expect Q1 to be kind of mid-teens growth over Q1 - I'm sorry, low teens growth over Q1 last year. And we'll talk a little bit more about long-range growth targets when we're together on Thursday.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. Great. Thanks John.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
John Holmes:
Great. Well, thank you very much. We appreciate the time and interest, everyone, and we look forward to seeing many of you on Thursday. Thank you.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

March 21, 2023
Operator:
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Call. We're joined today by John Holmes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, these statements are no guarantee of future performance. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in the company's earnings release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 and Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2022. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. Certain non-GAAP financial information will be discussed on the call today. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is set forth in the company's earnings release. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2023 results. Before I comment on the results, I would like to highlight the acquisition of Trax that we announced yesterday. This is a combination that we have been thinking about together with Trax for almost 10 years and we've worked carefully with the founders on the strategic vision for the combined organization. Trax is one of the leading third-party providers of MRO and fleet management software globally. It supports over 100 customers and approximately 5,000 aircraft, providing software for managing the entire spectrum of maintenance activities. These activities include many things such as inventory planning and purchasing, maintenance scheduling, engineering, work order processing, mobile task cards, electronic log books and personnel management. Additionally, Trax is a critical piece of software as it serves as a system of record required for airlines and MRO's by the FAA and other global regulators. For over 20 years, Trax has competed successfully against much larger players and has established itself as the leading independent provider of maintenance ERP software. The success in the market given their size speaks to the strength of the products and we believe that with AAR's backing will help them compete even more effectively. For AAR this acquisition accelerates our digital strategy, adding a platform for bringing additional software tools and analytical solutions to our customers and creating a unique channel to offer AAR products and services. In addition, it squarely furthers our stated objective to add differentiated IP-based higher margin solutions to our aviation aftermarket offerings. The Trax leadership team will remain with the business and we will retain the Trax brand and identity in the marketplace. Turning to the quarter. Sales were up 15% from $452 million in the prior year quarter to $520 million -- $521 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 19% from $0.63 per share to $0.75 per share. Our sales to commercial customers increased 28% and our sales to government customers decreased 3%, reflecting the prior wind down of certain programs last fiscal year. Sequentially sales to customers increased 9% and sales to government customers increased 15%. Our commercial parts activities continued the momentum that we described last quarter. New parts distribution benefited from the continued recovery in commercial flying as well as the recent contract wins, which were also contributing to the results. And as expected, the investments that we made in our USM activities last quarter have already generated early returns. We remain focused on additional opportunities to deploy capital to support our parts activities. In MRO, we continued the strong performance that we've seen for the past several quarters, remaining nearly at capacity. And I'm pleased to report that on our government business, we were able to identify short-term opportunities that drove sequential growth in the quarter. We also delivered another strong quarter with respect to profitability as our operating margin was 7.6% on an adjusted basis, up from 6.7% last year and consistent with the strong performance in Q2. This was driven by our revenue growth and our ability to continue to leverage the lower cost structure that we established during the pandemic. With respect to cash, we generated cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations of $17.4 million during the quarter. Our net leverage at the end of Q3 was 0.8 times EBITDA, pro forma for the Trax acquisition, our net leverage was 1.35 times EBITDA. At this level, we continue to have significant balance sheet flexibility to further fund our growth. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Sean Gillen to discuss the results in more detail.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $521.1 million were up 15.2% year-over-year. Our commercial sales were up 28.1%, driven by growth across our commercial activities. Our government sales were down 3% due to the completion of certain government programs in our previous fiscal year. Sequentially, our commercial sales were up 8.9% and our government sales were up 14.9%. Gross profit margin in the quarter was 18.1% versus 17.8% in the prior year quarter. Gross profit margin in our commercial business was 18.1% and gross profit margin in our government business was 18%. The margins in the quarter reflect continued strong performance in our parts supply and MRO activities, as well as favorable adjustments on the government contracts related to improved recovery on overhead costs and contract performance. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $56.7 million. This figure includes a net $4 million related to certain items that are excluded from our adjusted financial results. These items are detailed in the earnings press release. Excluding these items, our SG&A decreased to 10.1% of sales in the quarter, which drove our adjusted operating margin performance of 7.6%. Net interest expense for the quarter was $3.5 million compared to $0.6 million last year, driven by higher interest rates and borrowings. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.8%. We would expect our Q4 effective income tax rate to be approximately 28%. Cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $17.4 million, including a $25 million reduction in inventory in the quarter. We ended the quarter with net debt of $135.3 million and net leverage of 0.75 times EBITDA, which is down from 0.88 times EBITDA at the end of our fiscal Q2 in November. With respect to the Trax acquisition, we announced and closed the transaction yesterday. The consideration was $120 million in cash upfront, plus up to $20 million earn-out based on calendar year 2023 and 2024 adjusted revenue performance. This represents a purchase multiple of 14 times LTM EBITDA on the $120 million. Trax generated calendar year 2022 revenue of $25 million with approximately 35% EBITDA margins. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to adjusted EPS, which will exclude the non-cash amortization resulting from purchase accounting. Note that the $20 million earn-out consideration will be reflected in our SG&A over the two-year period, as there are retention conditions, where we were excluded from our adjusted results. Based on the closing date, Trax will contribute a little more than two months to fiscal Q4. We would expect it to contribute $3 million to $4 million in sales, with EBITDA margins around 35%. Interest expense in the quarter will be impacted by the upfront of $120 million at an interest rate of approximately 6%. As mentioned, we expect Trax to be accretive to adjusted EPS in FY'24. On a pro forma basis, our net leverage at the end of Q3 was 1.35 times EBITDA and our liquidity from remaining cash on hand and availability under our revolver was over $340 million. As you have indicated previously, our priorities for capital deployment are in order, organic growth investments in our business, value accretive inorganic investments to add complementary capabilities and capital return to shareholders. Over the last couple of quarters, we've had attractive opportunities to deploy capital in the first two categories. As a result, we elected not to repurchase stock during Q3. We currently have $58 million remaining on the $150 million stock repurchase program that we announced in December of 2021. We will evaluate usage of the remaining authorization over the balance of this calendar year based upon alternative capital deployment opportunities. Thank you for your attention, and I'll now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. Looking forward, although macroeconomic uncertainty and concerns about the global banking industry are watch item for all companies, we continue to be optimistic about the recovery in global flying and the resiliency of the aerospace aftermarket generally. The demand outlook for international travel is particularly strong and our commercial customers remain confident in their bookings. This is translating to continued strong demand in our hangers and for our commercial parts activities. We expect continued growth in new parts distribution, which is benefiting both from recovering and demand, and the ramp up of recent contract wins. And in USM, we are seeing a loosening in the availability of supply and as we mentioned last quarter, engine green time availability is decreasing, which should drive even more engine shop visits and associated USM demand. In MRO, demand for heavy maintenance continues to be strong and we expect to remain at near capacity for the foreseeable future. We continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our network where we have customers who have made commitments and confidence in long-term labor availability. With respect to our government business, we continue to be well positioned to add additional short-term and long-term programmatic wins as a function of our best value, commercial best practices offerings. And we remain excited about the potential impact of the new NDAA language that facilitates the government's ability to act on more of our offerings. Our Q3 results were driven by strong performance in both commercial and government markets. With respect to Q4, we expect continued growth in commercial, but expect a slight sequential decline in our government business. As such, overall in Q4, we expect similar to slightly better performance in total revenue and adjusted EPS relative to what we just delivered in Q3. We expect growth to continue in our commercial business and growth to resume in our government business as we begin our FY '24. Speaking of FY '24, we plan to hold an Investor Day in New York City on July 20. More information will be forthcoming and we look forward to providing more detail on our strategy as we've done in the past. Before opening it up to questions, I want to again express my excitement about the Trax acquisition. We've known the company and its management team for a decade and I could not be more pleased that the opportunity finally emerged to join forces. To reiterate what I said when I was with the Trax team yesterday in Miami, we see this as a unique opportunity to bring together AAR's hardware and Trax's software to support the global aerospace aftermarket in a way that has the potential to be extremely powerful over time. I look forward to the great things that we can achieve together and I welcome a highly successful Trax team to the AAR family. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
Hi. Thank you very much.
John Holmes:
Hey, Rob. How are you?
Robert Spingarn:
Good. Thanks. Congrats guys on your acquisition. I want to start there, if I could.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Rob.
Robert Spingarn:
Can you talk a little bit about how Trax can grow differently now that it's part of AAR versus whatever it's been doing in the past?
John Holmes:
Yeah. Great question. A couple of thoughts there. Trax is relative to some of the other players in the market. They're about the smallest, just in terms of size, but they have a very broad market reach and have been among the most successful in the last several years in terms of market penetration. One of the reasons that -- the main reason why they've been successful is just the strength of their product. They've got about the best product out there, and that's why they've been winning. What's worked against them is, just the fact that they've been a sole proprietorship essentially in Miami. And we believe that by combining with them, AAR as a much larger well-financed backer can help them open doors that they might not have otherwise been able to open. So that's one element. Furthermore, AAR, just given our presence in the globe, our reach around the industry, we also think that we can introduce Trax to more customers that they may not have otherwise been able to reach already.
Robert Spingarn:
Is there a growth rate that we can talk about what they've been growing at, and what you can do going forward?
John Holmes:
Yeah. We can get more specific on that at a later time, but they have been growing very, very nicely. Again, we've been following the company for about 10 years and have seen their evolution in their platforms. For example, when we first started talking to them, not surprisingly, their software set largely on mainframes and desktops. In other words, it was localized. They have re-platform. They have a whole suite of new offerings, new apps, if you will, and they're moving their users in the next generations to the cloud, and it's a SaaS-based offering. So as that new offering takes hold and as they migrate current customers to the new platform that has driven growth the last couple of years and we expect it will drive continued growth in the next few years.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then as an adjacent question, John, how can the Trax business drive your core legacy businesses? In other words, once you combine these two things, is it too optimistic to think it can drive more parts sales or more distribution, what have you?
John Holmes:
I don't think that's optimistic at all. In fact, that's exactly how we're thinking about it. Ultimately, Trax is the system used by thousands and thousands of buyers and planners at airlines around the world. And this is a system that is used to actually make the purchase from AAR for our products and services that we offer. And our plan is to basically bring more of our services closer to the customers and give customers around the world broader access to parts and parts availability.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And just a couple of other quick things. With this wide body resurgence, how are you seeing that play out in your markets and does it tempt you to get into more wide body MRO?
John Holmes:
From an -- we are seeing it certainly play out. From an MRO standpoint, we remain focused on our core offering around narrow body. That's -- we've taken great steps over the last several years to really focus on that market and that's where our strength is. From a parts standpoint though, particularly around engines, the power wide bodies, that's an area that we are in today, predominantly in the cargo market. . But as we see more passenger aircraft take to the sky, we see opportunities to take the part business to support that growth.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then just the only other thing I wanted to ask you John is, you talked about the USM strength and recent investments. And I just want to understand better where we are in this USM cycle. I would have thought that a lot of whatever materials out there on parked aircraft et cetera., might have been depleted by now. So if you could just update us on what's happening?
John Holmes:
I think you're correct in terms of material out of parked aircraft, but we haven't seen the elevated levels of retirements that have been forecasted for many years, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic. As OEM production rates come up and as airlines reflect their aircraft, we do expect to see more retirements over time, although that dramatic jump that many talked about for so long, we don't expect that. But we do expect that curve to steepen over the next few years, and that will provide more material for our USM business.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Thanks so much.
John Holmes:
Great. Thanks, Rob.
Operator:
Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Benchmark Company. Your line is open.
Josh Sullivan:
Hey. Good evening.
John Holmes:
Hey, Josh. How are you doing?
Josh Sullivan:
[indiscernible] Just on the government services side, what does the recompete outlook, like over the next 12 months or so?
John Holmes:
For existing programs that we're on, off the top of my head, I don't -- I'm not aware of any major recompetes for programs that we are currently on. However, there are a number of recompetes in process right now for programs that we are not on, and we are a bidder on those programs. To the extent we're successful, that would be a net new work for AAR.
Josh Sullivan:
And can you just expand on the comment about the NDAA language that allows more access to air services?
John Holmes:
Yeah. We talked a little bit about that last quarter and ultimately ended up in the most recent version of the NDA that was passed was language that requires branches of the DoD to consider buying used parts anytime they go to the market. And so our used parts offering, which, as you know, has been very successful in the commercial market, now as agencies as they look to buy parts are required to give that a look. And we expect over time as these agencies become more educated on the benefits of buying USM that could be a growth market for us.
Josh Sullivan:
And then, are there any opportunities for Trax in the government sector?
John Holmes:
That's a great question. Yes, we believe so. They do a little bit of work in the government area already. As a matter of fact, the FAA itself is actually a Trax customer, but we believe, again, similar to the commercial market, there are doors in government agencies, but because of our presence, we can help open for Trax.
Josh Sullivan:
And then, on the distribution [Technical Difficulty] on the commercial side, availability look like coming from the OEMs. Any supply chains getting better? Just any comments on what you're seeing there?
John Holmes:
I'd say it's stable. It's been stable over the last few quarters and when we think about supply chain for our business, certainly availability of labor, we kind of put in the supply chain bucket. But as it relates to parts availability, from the OEMs and repair turnaround times both of those elements have stabilized in the last few quarters. Lead times still are longer for the most part than they were pre-pandemic. So we just adjusted our buying patterns to account for that. And similarly, as we manage parts in the USM business that we send out for repair, we’ve accounted for longer turnaround times as we look to buy and market material.
Josh Sullivan:
Great. Thank you for the time.
John Holmes:
Great. Thanks, Josh.
Operator:
Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey. Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. John, just on the -- into the fourth quarter, I mean it's usually seasonally your strongest quarter, but I think you called for flattish revenues. I mean is this just still the dynamic of coming off the COVID recovery or is there any reason why we should think kind of the airlines prepping for the summer flying season wouldn't be as strong as kind of pre-COVID conditions or just what's kind of going on with the dynamic there?
John Holmes:
Yeah. Really two elements in both commercial and government. In Commercial, we do for all the reasons you just mentioned, we expect continued growth sequentially in Q4. The parts businesses remain strong. MRO remains strong, and we expect continued growth in commercial. What’s partially offsetting that is the government side. We've mentioned this a few quarters ago, as we saw the wind down of certain long-term government contracts, we have been able to offset a fair bit of that wind down with shorter-term government activities. We were successful in doing that in Q3, which accounted for the strong government program performance in Q3. However, we don't expect that same level of activity on the government side in Q4, which net-net leads us to a, I would say, similar to slightly better overall Q4 in revenue and EPS than what we delivered in Q3.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. Can you elaborate on what that short-term activity is? I mean, is that just picking up ad-hoc, logistics, repair work or maybe elaborate kind of what you're doing there?
John Holmes:
Some of it is the tempo and individual programs that we see and other of it is more transactional parts of activity with the government.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Okay. And then just back to Trax, I mean just having that asset in-house, you're mentioning all the customers, all the aircraft, does (ph) this gives you better intelligence on what type of material might be in higher demand? Does it give you a little bit of an advantage in terms of buying USM or feedstock that's out there?
John Holmes:
Ultimately, Trax manages a tremendous amount of data for its customer base. and that is Trax data and owned by Trax customers. Over time, we want to work with Trax and their customers, many of whom are our customers to see how in partnership with everybody, we might be able to use that to offer more parts and solutions, more parts availability to the Trax customer base. So yes, over time, we believe that will be an accelerant to our traditional businesses.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Okay. And then just the last one. On the JV with Fortress, I mean they're out there kind of they're telling a pretty good story. I mean they're obviously going after the CFM 56 is. But are they going to be I guess I'm trying to think about the dynamic of you guys trying to. You have access to some of that engine material, but it sounds like they also are focused on ramping up their USM. I mean, is that contract in that JV playing out as expected or are there any sort of competitive dynamics there in terms of going after similar material or just maybe a little bit more color on kind of the workings of that relationship?
John Holmes:
Yeah. Good question. So the JV that we have with them and the overall relationship is going as well, if not better than we expected when we originally outlined it. I think possibly what you’re hearing there is just different activity on different platforms. So the platforms in which we’re covering with Fortress there’s a lot of respect and again, a lot of good momentum around that relationship. Fortress has got a broad engine port portfolio, and they’re talking about other areas, not the areas where we’re in partnership with them.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Okay. Perfect. I’ll jump back in the queue.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC. Your line is open.
Stephen Strackhouse:
Hey, John and Sean. This is actually Steve Strackhouse on for Ken Herbert. Congrats on the strong quarter. Just a couple of quick questions starting with Trax. How are you thinking about the cost synergy capture with that opportunity? And then now that you've acquired Trax, what is your view on maybe further M&A that you might be looking at for FY '24?
John Holmes:
Great. Thanks. Appreciate the question. First, with respect to Trax, we are not really focused on cost synergy at this point. This is really a growth play. As we mentioned earlier, we believe that can help grow Trax's revenues by funding further development of their products and services and by opening doors for them around the world with a larger customer base, government included. So we really view this from a synergy perspective around growing revenues of Trax. And then similarly on AAR side, again, over time, as we develop Trax and work in cooperation with their customers, we think this could be a unique channel to market for our traditional products and services, which would in turn grow our own revenue. So really, it's a revenue synergy play with track. And then thinking about M&A, as you heard from Sean, we think about capital deployment first organically; second, inorganically M&A and then third, returning capital to shareholders. We are very encouraged right now by the pipeline of M&A opportunities that we see. We have been following many assets for many, many years. Trax is an outstanding example of that. We've been working with them and thinking about this deal for really about 10 years, and it's great to get it over the finish line. There are other companies out there that we expect to come to market here in the next -- in the medium term. And with the balance sheet strength that we have, provided that it fits the portfolio and the value makes sense, we're in a great position to act.
Stephen Strackhouse:
Awesome. And then maybe just one follow-up from there. We touched a little bit on you spoke in the prepared remarks and a few of the questions. But as you look at some of the asset acquisitions, where are you seeing some of the buying opportunity? Is it with engines, maybe airframes and how is that pricing trending for the available feedstock?
John Holmes:
I would say first part, we are seeing it in both categories, individuals on their own as well as whole airframes that come with engines. And so we have seen more packages come available in the last couple of quarters. And we expect to see more material come on the market. And again, we're in a very strong position to act on that. With respect to pricing, I wouldn't want to comment on that element just for competitive concerns, but we are encouraged by the assets that we see coming available.
Stephen Strackhouse:
Awesome. Thank you. Thanks guys.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you very much.
Operator:
Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
John Holmes:
Well, that’s great. Thank you very much, everyone for your time and attention, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Operator:
Good afternoon everyone and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Call. We're joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, these statements are no guarantee of future performance. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in the company's earnings release and the Risk Factors sections of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 and Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2022. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. Certain non-GAAP financial information will be discussed on the call today. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is set forth in the company's earnings release. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you and good afternoon, everybody. I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2023 results. Sales for the quarter were up 8% from $437 million in the prior year quarter to $470 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 30% from $0.53 per share to $0.69 per share. Our sales to commercial customers increased 21% and our sales to government and defense customers decreased 12%. Sequentially, sales to commercial customers increased 6% [ph] and sales to government customers increased 3%. I'm pleased that we continue to see progress in the recovery of our commercial volumes, notwithstanding the fact that global flights are still down approximately 20% from 2019 levels. In particular, in our cards activities, we saw sequential improvement in the demand for both USM and new parts distribution. While this is encouraging, we have been more encouraged by the opportunity for further improvement as the volume in these activities is still down over 20% from our FY '20 levels. On top of this, we expect the full ramp-up of our new distribution agreements and the increased adoption of USM to provide growth opportunities beyond the market recovery. In MRO, we were able to generate sequential growth driven by facility optimization and growth in the non-hanger portions of our MRO operations. Our government sales continue to reflect the prior wind-down of certain programs, including Afghanistan and I'm pleased that we returned to sequential growth this quarter. With respect to margins, we delivered another strong quarter as our operating margin was 7.6% on an adjusted basis, up from 6.1% last year and 6.9% last quarter. This reflects our commitment to cost discipline, a mix shift towards parts which is our highest margin activity and outperformance on certain programs. We do continue to experience labor market tightness but that appears to be stabilizing and the programs that we established years ago to create a proprietary set of labor pipelines continue to serve us well. In addition, we are engaging with our customers regarding price increases for calendar year 2023 in order to address the higher labor costs we are experiencing. As we indicated during last quarter's call, we had compelling opportunities during the quarter to invest in new long-term business and in attractive USM assets. These investments totaled approximately $60 million in the quarter which drove a use of cash and operating activities from continuing operations of $46 million. We also repurchased $28 million of stock in the quarter under our share repurchase program. Even after the investments and the share repurchase, our net leverage was 0.9x EBITDA and we continue to have significant balance sheet strength and flexibility. Among the investments in new business or new long-term business that we announced during the quarter was the expansion of our distribution relationship with Unison. This significant new agreement broadens our long-term distribution of select units and igniter plugs, ignition leads, harnesses and related spare parts to now cover all aftermarket customers worldwide. Also during the quarter, we announced a new multiyear flight hour component support agreement with flydubai which expands our support to include the new addition of flying -- flydubai's growing fleet of 737 MAX aircraft. Finally, we signed a new Airinmar agreement with Philippines-based low-cost carrier, Cebu Pacific to provide a full suite of services covering both aircraft, warranty management and value engineering. Before I turn it over to Sean, I would like to comment on the inclusion in the DoD's FY '23 National Defense Authorization Act of a position stating that the Navy and Air Force will implement processes and procedures for acquiring used serviceable material to support their commercial derivative aircraft and engines. Historically, the U.S. government has acquired mainly new aircraft and new aircraft parts. This legislation institutionalizes the process for the DoD to consider the use of USM as a better value solution whenever it's available and is an initial step in the unlocking of a significant untapped market for our used parts offerings. Over the years, we have found great partners in Congress on a variety of initiatives and I would like to thank them for their work on this important opportunity to drive taxpayer value. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Sean Gillen, to discuss the results in more detail.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $469.8 million were up 7.6% or $33.2 million year-over-year. Our commercial sales were up 21%, while our government sales were down 11.7% due to the completion of certain government programs, including our Afghanistan contracts. Sequentially, our commercial sales were up 6.2% and our government sales were up 3.5%. Gross profit margin in the quarter was 18.3% versus 18% in the prior year quarter and adjusted gross profit margin was 18.8% versus 16.7% in the prior year quarter. Gross profit margin in our commercial business was 18.4% and gross profit margin in our government business was 18%. The increased margins in the quarter reflect continued strong performance in our parts supply and MRO activities as well as favorable cost performance on certain commercial and government contracts driving higher contract profitability in the period. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $52.8 million. This figure includes continuing investments in our digital initiatives as well as $1.1 million related to investigation and remediation business. Net interest expense for the quarter was $2 million compared to $0.4 million last year, driven by higher interest rates and borrowings. As John indicated, cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was $45.9 million, driven by investment in new long-term business wins and the acquisition of inventory to support our USM activities. In addition, we bought back approximately 700,000 shares or $28.2 million which is higher than prior quarters as we took advantage of favorable market dynamics in our open window. We have the balance sheet strength to continue to invest in our business as well as to continue to execute on our share repurchase program on which we have $57.6 million of authorization remaining. We ended the quarter with net debt of $149 million and net leverage of only 0.9x. In addition, last week, we extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility for another 5 years and increased the size from $600 million to $620 million which gives us significant liquidity. We appreciate the continued support of our bank group and executing that extension and upsizing. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. Looking forward, our largest North American airline customers continue to be confident about demand resiliency and expansion. We are also encouraged by recent signs of demand improvement in Europe and early indications are that the easing of lockdown restrictions in China, were flying activity is still down 70% from pre-COVID from 2019 levels is already leading to an increase in flight hours. In addition, we are beginning to see signs that engine green time availability for certain carriers may be dwindling which will lead to increased engine shop visits which are an important source of demand for our USM parts. We've been anticipating this inflection point for some time and we are now seeing early signs that is occurring. With respect to our government business, we expect long-term contract and short-term procurement wins to continue to contribute for the balance of this fiscal year, leading to continued growth. Overall, we expect sequential sales growth in Q3 to be consistent with the increase in Q2 and we expect further growth in Q4. We expect margins in Q3 to be in line with levels we have seen over the last few quarters. In the medium and the longer term, we believe that we are exceptionally well positioned for growth for several reasons. First, commercial market conditions are favorable including strong leisure and business travel demand, the reopening of international markets following the relaxation of travel restrictions and OEM production challenges that are extending the life of the existing fleet; second, our parts volumes although recovering are still well below pre-COVID levels and we have every reason to believe that they will not only fully recover but also grow based on increased acceptance of USM and the maturation of several recently awarded new parts distribution contracts; and third, our government programs offering is consistent with the best value commercial best practices support that the U.S. government is increasingly seeking and the new NDAA language facilitates the government's ability to act on more of our offerings. Further, we are supplementing these growth initiatives with investments in digital efficiency which, along with improved operating leverage and a mix shift towards parts to continue to drive margin expansion. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst:
John, wanted to open with maybe a higher level industry question. But there's some discussion at the slower-than-expected OE ramp from Airbus and Boeing will drive an extended aftermarket cycle for the next couple of years. I wanted to ask your thoughts on this, John.
John Holmes:
Yes, we would agree with that. And we think that's one of the core favorable trends that gives us confidence in the growth we're talking about in as much as the platforms that are bread and butter for us are going to be flying longer than people anticipated originally.
Unidentified Analyst:
And then you talked a little bit about USM. I was going to ask perhaps for a little bit more color on where the USM market is today? And then -- and maybe you could segue that into your comment on the NDAA and talk about your reach into military USM versus commercial where you clearly have a strong track record.
John Holmes:
Sure. The U.S. market in general, we talked a couple of quarters ago about anticipating an inflection point in the recovery of that business and that was related both towards the demand as well as the supply. The demand out of customers has taken a bit longer than we anticipated at that time to come back. And there have been a number of factors driving that but most recently, what we have seen and heard from our customers is that they were still utilizing a lot of green time on engines. In other words, they had aircraft that were parked, in many cases, due to pilot shortages and then we're moving engines around to defer maintenance. For key customers that we support, that green time is dwindling and those engines and that deferred maintenance is now coming due. And so the engine shops, for example, that we support we are seeing signs of increased demand as they look at their input schedule for 2023. So we believe that inflection point in terms of demand we're at the beginning of that. Coupling that with surplus material availability, it has been a very tight market. We have just recently started to see things come available for certain asset types that we support. And that was one of the reasons we put out the capital this quarter was to move quickly to acquire that material. And we are seeing, even as we look into early next year, more opportunities to put capital to work to acquire materials to support that anticipated increased demand for USM. So that's the commercial market. The government market we've had success here and there in terms of selling used material to the government. In some cases, on a small parts basis but in other cases, in a whole aircraft basis like we did a couple of years ago with C-40s. But we haven't ever had a structural change in the law which is what's reflected in the NDAA language that compels services like the Air Force and the Navy to consider USM. So for commercial derivative aircraft like the C-40 of the PA which are 737,and the C-32 which is the 757, we think this could be the starting point of meaningful opportunities for AAR. How much and how long, I think, is the question but we're really encouraged by the fact that, that language is now part of the NDAA.
Unidentified Analyst:
Okay. And then, Sean, if you're able to, can you parse out the 21% commercial aero growth in the quarter across the sub business lines?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. I think 21% really across all commercial activity that say we saw outsized performance in our distribution business which reflects some of the new business wins over the last several years. And then also within our commercial PVH which is a flight hour driven a little bit more international than some of our other commercial activities, we saw improved flight hour activity which drove that top line. But strength across all commercial that highlight those two is driving some of the outperformance.
Unidentified Analyst:
Okay. And then just how do you expect with maybe continued investment in distribution, how should we think about cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year?
John Holmes:
Yes. I think if you look at our cash performance over the last 8 or 9 quarters, we’re really proud of the cash that we’ve generated. And obviously, that’s reflected by the low leverage ratio on the balance sheet. The inventory positions we had have been a source of cash. But as we look forward, we would expect to be more in investing mode in the back half of this year the way we were in the second quarter.
Operator:
Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC.
Ken Herbert:
John, I just wanted to start out maybe on the usage of working capital this quarter. Can you parse out maybe how much of that was for maybe to support distribution agreements versus assets on the USM side. And on the USM side, guessing it’s maybe more engines versus other systems. What are you seeing in terms of pricing? Are you seeing a significant uptake in what you’re having to pay to acquire the assets just considering the tight supply? How should we think about that?
John Holmes:
Yes. As the -- so the first part is the capital breaks down, it was slightly more towards the USM side. If we think about the 2 areas, USM and new parts distribution agreements, we're skewed slightly more towards USM but fairly equal between the two. And then on -- and then on the new parts distribution agreements, I mean those are our initial provisioning inventory buys that go on with these contracts when we take them on. And obviously, we worked down those positions over time as the contracts mature. As it relates to pricing in USM, I wouldn't want to get into that, in particular, for competitive reasons but it remains a tight market and we're able to achieve the right spreads between the prices that we pay for material and the prices at which we sell material. So we're kind of market in, market out as it relates to these USM buys.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. That’s helpful. And as we think about moving forward, you’ve obviously been extending some agreements like with Unison. It seems like you’re bringing in some new OEM customers. What’s the landscape like for additional OEM partners as you think about incremental distribution agreements. It sounds like there’s more out there considering your comments regarding sort of cash usage in the second half of the fiscal year?
John Holmes:
Yes. We see a lot of opportunity in distribution. We see opportunity to expand agreements with our partners like Unison and we're real proud of that expansion. It's a big one for us and that's a 10-year-old relationship and we're still finding more things to do with them. And we have a number of other long-term OEM relationships that are in the same category where there's opportunities to expand as they rethink their approach to aftermarket coming out of COVID. And then there's new areas. The -- we've got an agreement with Leach that we announced that we expanded. That's a new market for us. That's electronics distribution. So we're selling piece parts into production line. So that's a new market for us and Leach is the launch deal there which we've extended and we see more opportunity in that market. There's also opportunities in the BAGA market. Obviously, a lot of interest in BA coming out of COVID that's been a very strong market in general and we think that our way to participate in that market is through distribution. And so that, again, would be a new focus for us but a number of OEMs that we're talking to have interest in leveraging our distribution network.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, very helpful. And you've often talked in the past about sort of seeing a step change ideally in aviation margins. As you start to see the recovery in the parts business, specifically, I guess, surplus material being one of the higher margin pieces of the business. How do we -- how should we think about margins in that segment in the second half as you're starting to see this acceleration in some of the agreements here and obviously availability of USM and increasing demand?
John Holmes:
Yes. I think margins in general, we had a very strong quarter this quarter. I think margins in general in Q3 from the immediate term would be consistent with the last few quarters that we've delivered. And again, you've seen some pretty consistent performance there. That's in the immediate term. Beyond that, to your point, as the mix continues to shift towards parts as we recover and grow in that business and we start to get some efficiencies in MRO as a result of some of these digital initiatives, in particular, that we've been investing in, we would expect continued expansion beyond that kind of 7% level as those things take hold over the medium and the long term.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. Helpful. And just one final question. In the past, I know you’ve got a cost reduction effort going on. In the past, I think you had a target of sort of getting SG&A down to 10% or under of sales. And I know it’s not something you’ve talked about recently. But how do you think about the cost opportunities moving forward? Is it on the SG&A line? Is it other parts of the business? Where should we look for you to sort of have more cost opportunity over the next few quarters and into fiscal ‘24?
John Holmes:
Yes, great. Great question. We see -- so first of all, getting to that 10% or below SG&A as a percent of sales is still a goal. We believe that a more significant contributor towards reaching that goal will be the recovery in the top line. We took a lot of costs out there in COVID as you know, made a lot of structural changes to the business. And our focus right now is just staying disciplined in terms of preserving those changes as we grow. So as top line continues to recover, we expect that percentage to come down. The other thing I would point out is we are making investments, particularly in the digital area that we do expense and so they flow through those lines. Those investments are very much – we’re in the thick of those right now but they’re projects. They’ve got a beginning in the middle of an end. And as we wrap up those projects, we would expect those expenses to come down and the efficiency as a result of those projects to start to kick in.
Operator:
Our next question comes from the line of Ciarmoli.
Mike Ciarmoli:
Maybe just on that SG&A, I think you were up about maybe 5% or so, almost $3 million sequentially. Was there anything specifically that drove that in the quarter? Or was that kind of all part of the digital investment and expensing some of those items you were just talking about?
John Holmes:
It's predominantly that. It's predominantly that. I mean, we have, in certain areas, we've seen people costs go up as well. And so that's contributing to it. And that some of the relief ultimately, we hope to get through some price adjustments to offset that but it's those investments in those projects and then certain labor costs that are flowing through that line.
Mike Ciarmoli:
Got it. Got it. And then maybe just back to kind of Rob's first question on kind of the -- just the more broader trends in the aftermarket. Is there any validity to maybe the thought that we could see a low in aftermarket activity when we look at claims coming off warranty? I mean, if we go back to the 2018 period, planes coming off. There's obviously going to be this period where we have fewer new planes coming off the assembly line, maybe those first-time shop visits. I mean, is that something you guys are looking at as you get out into '23 and '24? How that dynamic plays out?
John Holmes:
I think that's definitely a dynamic to pay attention to. However, from where we sit, the more powerful dynamic is the extension of the current fleet as a result of those production delays.
Mike Ciarmoli:
Yes. Okay. Okay, got it. Last one I had, Sean, just the government looks to be trending down. I guess it will be maybe 15%, 17% in terms of revenue for the year. Is that kind of the right expectation? Or are there any new wins or things ramping up that might create a little bit of an inflection here?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. I think we saw some modest sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. And as John mentioned in his cost, I think we’d expect to see a little bit of that modest growth continue over the balance of the year as some of the longer-term contracts that are replenishing things that had ended as well as some more short-term procurement activity for the government will show up in the results over the second half.
Operator:
Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Benchmark.
Josh Sullivan:
On the green time availability comment, how are you measuring that? Or maybe what metrics are you tracking to give you so much confidence that we’re hitting this critical crossover?
John Holmes:
It's really driven by the key customers that we support and their shop input schedule as they look over the next 6 to 12 months. So you haven't seen the engine overhauls come through in a way that we expect to see them now based on what we're talking -- or based on what we're hearing from our customers. So shop inputs would be the key metric.
Josh Sullivan:
Got it. And then just on the labor kind of question, how are airlines looking at their internal labor availability or cost versus the outsourcing option to air? Does it take – excuse me, does the tight labor market help the outsourcing dynamic for you?
John Holmes:
I think it's a challenge for everybody. So I think it's really a level playing field. So I don't know that it necessarily changes the calculus at the airlines in terms of whether to bring in work or outsource work. I think that's a relatively stable relationship. So our discussions are all positive in terms of the amount of work that they -- would like to continue to outsource to companies like ours.
Josh Sullivan:
Got it. And then just one last one. As we exit COVID here into change markets, you’re making the digital investments, you’re re-establishing some relationships with fly-to-buy and others. But what do you think the long-term kind of strategic vision or positioning is for Air? It’s been a while since we had an Investor Day. Do you see any changing in that positioning? Or just curious kind of on the longer-term outlook.
John Holmes:
Well, I think, first of all, we anticipate now that we can all be together again, we do anticipate getting back at a regular cadence with Investor Day this next year. So we're looking forward to that opportunity. But as it relates to the overall strategy, certainly, we want to wait until we have an opportunity to discuss that more fully. But as you can tell, I mean, we remain very focused on building out our parts capability. We're having a lot of success there both on the USM and on the new parts distribution side. Our MRO portfolio is operating at a level of efficiency that we hadn’t experienced prior to COVID, so we want to make sure that we preserve that and in areas where we can expand MRO where we have long-term customer interest and long-term access to labor, we expect to do that and look for ways to grow in that business. You mentioned digital, digital, there’s elements that benefit us internally from efficiency but then also digital offerings like Airinmar and AIRVOLUTION that drive new sources of revenue for us. And then we continue to look at ways to bring areas of IP, whether it’s through PMA parts or DER repairs into the portfolio to drive continued margin improvement. And finally, we remain in a very strong position with the U.S. government. We’ve really built a meaningful portfolio of past performance that allows us to bid on a variety of contracts. We’ve got a very strong pipeline of bids there and work as well as bids that are with the government right now. And so we feel very good position to continue to be successful as a prime contractor there.
Operator:
We have a follow-up question from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC.
Ken Herbert:
John, it sounds like you've got a pretty significant set of organic investment opportunities as you think about USM, distribution and other areas and what you just went through. Should we assume that M&A or meaningful M&A is off the table? Or how should we think about that in terms of capital allocation?
John Holmes:
No, great question. And no, I certainly would not want to suggest that M&A is off the table. Our framework for capital allocation is organic investment first, inorganic investment M&A second and then returning capital to shareholders. And the balance sheet remains very strong. We're still less than 1x levered. So we believe we've got the opportunity to deploy capital in the first area, organic investment but then also keep options open for M&A. And there are a number of companies out there that could be very interesting to us. Some are new, some we've been following for years. And to the extent that we find an opportunity where evaluation and our strategy align, we absolutely would pursue M&A.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. And just finally, you did just call out PMA again. You haven’t been talking about PMA as much recently and I know it had been sort of identified as a growth opportunity in the past. It seems like through your distribution agreements and everything else, you were becoming maybe a little bit more OEM aligned with the business strategy. Is PMA something, I think, that’s still seriously in the mix? Or how do we think about that in terms of priorities for you?
John Holmes:
Yes, I think it's very much in the mix. And it's a big world out there and we do see opportunities on a selective basis where we would not, in any way, be in conflict with our OEM partners to pursue PMA. We have an internal effort underway. It's very small. I was actually visiting the team a couple of weeks ago and there are some really exciting things that they're working on. But it's relative to the total of AAR, it's a small operation. But we do expect to scale it over time. It's just -- it's going to take a while. But the initiatives are around coming up with PMAs that are only available to us for use in our own repairs as well as PMAs that we could offer to third parties.
Operator:
I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
John Holmes:
Great. Well, we really appreciate everybody’s time and interest and I want to wish everyone a happy holiday and look forward to being back and discussing Q3. Thank you.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Operator:
Good day. And welcome to AAR Corp.’s Q1 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to AAR management for opening remarks. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Company Representative:
Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to AAR’s fiscal 2023 first quarter earnings call. We are joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, these statements are no guarantee of future performance. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in the company’s earnings release and the Risk Factors section of the company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. Certain non-GAAP financial information we discuss on the call today. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is set forth in the company’s earnings release. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR’s President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2023 results. Sales for the quarter were down 2% from $455 million in the prior year quarter to $446 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 17% from $0.52 per share to $0.61 per share. Our sales to Commercial customers increased to 10% and our sales to Government and Defense customers decreased 19%. In our Commercial business, we remain encouraged by the continued recovery in air travel. As we indicated last quarter, the recovery has been strongest domestically, while Europe and Asia have lagged behind, leading to global USMs that are still about 30% below 2019 levels. This is most relevant for our parts activities, which are our most international. Regarding our parts activities, we continue to see broadening interest in used material, but the mediate demand for used parts continues to be impacted by the utilization of green time, as well as the lack of material availability for certain high-demand assets. However, our new parts distribution activities continued to deliver meaningful growth. While contracts signed prior to COVID still have not fully recovered, the overall growth is being driven by the series of distributorships that we have signed in the last two years. We continue to take share in the new parts distribution market and expect that growth to persist. Finally, in MRO, our customers continue to signal strong demand for our services and we expect our hangers to remain largely full for the rest of the fiscal year. In our Government business, year-over-year, we saw the full impact of the exit from Afghanistan, as well as the completion of certain other programs. Sequentially, the decline was driven by reduced activity on certain short-term programs, as well as a more normal level of parts sales to the U.S. Government as compared to what we saw in Q4. As our recently awarded USAFE contract ramped up later this year and we win other contracts, we expect growth to resume in our Government business. Turning to margins, I am pleased to report that we delivered another strong quarter. Our operating margin was 6.9% on an adjusted basis, up from 5.5% last year. We continue to demonstrate that the structural changes we made during the pandemic have resulted in sustained margin improvement. Regarding cash flow, we generated $7 million from operating activities from continuing operations. We saw opportunities this quarter to acquire high-demand assets that we expect to drive growth in our parts activities. This is an example of our ability to use our strong balance sheet to move quickly to take advantage of market opportunities. We also repurchased $22 million of stock in the quarter under our share repurchase program. Even after the share repurchase, our net leverage was 0.4 times EBITDA and we continue to be exceptionally well positioned to fund our future growth. Turning to new wins, during the quarter, our Mobility Systems business was awarded $173.5 million firm fixed contract from the U.S. Airports to produce next-generation all-aluminum cargo pallets. We currently produce and repair the existing generation 463L cargo pallets and this award continues our support of the U.S. Air Force for many years to come. In addition, we were awarded a contract by the Norwegian Defence Logistics Organisation to provide parts for the Royal Norwegian Air Force P-8A fleet. This program builds on our successful strategic expansion in the government programs outside of the U.S. Finally, we announced the implementation of our Airvolution digital repair cycle management tool with Textron Aviation Defense. Airvolution is a customizable SaaS solution for optimizing the administration of aircraft component repairs and Textron Aviation Defense will rely on evolution to supplement and modernize its workflows for its repair orders. With that, I’ll turn it over to our CFO, Sean Gillen, who will discuss the details of the results.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $446.3 million were down 1.9% or $8.8 million year-over-year. Our Commercial sales were up 9.8%, while our Government sales were down 18.7% due to the completion of certain Government programs, including our Afghanistan contracts. Sequentially, our Commercial sales were approximately flat and our Government sales decreased 16.2%. Gross profit margin in the quarter was 18.4% versus 14.2% in the prior year quarter and adjusted gross profit margin was 18.1% versus 16.1% in the prior year quarter. Gross profit margin in our Commercial business was 18.2% and gross profit margin in our Government business was 18.6%. In Government, recent contract modifications that result in higher recovery on indirect costs, as well as favorable cost performance on a contract drove the strong margin performance. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $50.1 million. This figure includes continuing investments in our digital initiatives, as well as $0.8 million related to investigation and remediation matters. Net interest expense for the quarter was $1 million, compared to $0.7 million last year, driven by higher interest rates, notwithstanding lower borrowings. As John indicated, we generated cash flow from our operating activities from continuing operations of $7 million. In addition, we funded $21.9 million of share repurchase. Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with net debt of $70.7 million and net leverage of only 0.4 times. Consistent with the last three quarters, we expect to continue to execute on our plan to deploy the full $150 million share repurchase authorization over approximately two years from the time of announcement. Finally, we anticipate investing more significantly in inventory and rotable assets to support our growth. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. As you know, we are in a period of macro uncertainty regarding growth and inflation. That said, Commercial passenger traffic growth has historically been extremely resilient through economic cycles. For AAR, as I indicated earlier, in our hangers, we expect to remain largely full and even though the labor market remains tight, our partnerships with technical schools, as well as other labor pipeline initiatives continue to serve us well. In distribution, we are well positioned to continue to add new lines and to benefit from the eventual recovery in flying levels in Europe and Asia. And in trading, engine green time will ultimately dissipate and new aircraft deliveries will eventually lead to retirement as a source of supply for more used material. This all should lead to an inflection point in the recovery of our trading volumes. As we saw during the pandemic, our Government business has also proven to be resilient during macroeconomic weakness. In addition, our fundamental value proposition to deliver commercial best practices at a lower price point to resonate even more loudly with our Government customers during periods of budget tightening. As a result, we are confident in our ability to transition our Government pipeline, which remains very full into meaningful growth over time. With respect to the near-term outlook, we expect both sequential and year-over-year growth in Q2. Specifically, we expect sales to be in between the quarter we just finished and Q4 of last year, and we remain optimistic for continued sequential growth throughout the balance of this fiscal year. Over the long-term, we are uniquely positioned as the leading non-OEM non-airline provider of comprehensive aftermarket solutions globally. We are well balanced across Commercial and Government end markets, have the strong balance sheet to fuel market share growth and have a structurally improved margin profile that should translate into even greater value for our shareholders. With that, I’ll turn it over to the Operator for questions.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mike Ciarmoli with Truist. Please go ahead.
Mike Ciarmoli:
Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, John, you kind of just gave some color on what you expect for the year with kind of the sequential growth throughout. Just and even, I guess, Sean, talking about investing in inventory to anticipate the growth. I mean are you still expecting sort of inflection in the second half of this fiscal year? And then maybe can you give us a little bit of color on margins, certainly, good performance in the quarter, are you guys start to see more growth, should we expect margins to hold firm or are there going to be any mix issues that we should be aware of?
John Holmes:
Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Thanks for calling in. So, generally speaking, we -- if I think about the parts businesses in two areas, distribution, we expect to grow throughout the year. We’ve signed a number of agreements. Those contracts are maturing. You’re seeing continued recovery on agreements that were in place before COVID and we expect distribution to grow throughout the year. In terms of the aftermarket, the trading activities, I would say that, that inflection point, we need a couple of things to occur. We are seeing continued utilization of green time from our customers. So certain engine overhauls are being delayed that we would have anticipated by now because aircraft are on the ground. There’s aircraft on the ground due to pilot shortages and other reasons. So that’s pushing that inflection point out, but we still expect it to occur in the second half of the year. And then as it relates to margin, we -- you’ve seen the full benefit of the structural changes that we’ve made and that’s put us around the 7% operating -- adjusted operating margin ballpark. As the parts businesses recover both in distribution and in trading, and that’s the area where we still see the most opportunity for recovery and growth. Those businesses are margin accretive to where we are today and so as the mix shift in that direction, ultimately, that should improve margins further.
Mike Ciarmoli:
Got it. Got it. And then just on, I guess, investing in inventory for growth and even thinking about distribution, what’s -- what are you guys seeing in terms of supply chain, is there any challenges in terms of repairs or getting access to parts from your primary OEM suppliers or is that sort of lower on the radar screen for you guys behind maybe labor?
John Holmes:
Yeah. Good question. I would say labor is definitely the priority for us. But definitely in the distribution business, supply chain challenges are something that we’re focusing on. But the team has done a really good job managing that. So it’s had somewhat of an impact on the results over the last few quarters in terms of delayed deliveries, et cetera, but -- and extended repair times. But, overall, I think we’ve done a pretty good job managing through that.
Mike Ciarmoli:
Okay. Got it. And then just last one for me. Any update, I know you called it out last quarter on the ADL drag is. Any update there or kind of expectations, how we should think about that program?
John Holmes:
I would say no meaningful update…
Mike Ciarmoli:
Okay.
John Holmes:
… the program continues to go well and I know ADL was talking to a lot of interested customers.
Mike Ciarmoli:
Okay. Fair enough. I will jump back in the queue guys. Thanks.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Mike.
Operator:
Thank you. One moment for our next question and that will come from the line of Josh Sullivan with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.
Josh Sullivan:
Hey. Good evening.
John Holmes:
Hi, Josh.
Josh Sullivan:
I know you mentioned you expect hanger demand for the hangers to remain relatively full. Can you give us any color there, any changes in aircraft type, is it still a narrow-body? Are there any dynamics there that are changing in the reservations or is it still kind of the same demand?
John Holmes:
I’d say it’s largely the same. The vast majority of our activity is around narrow-body maintenance. What I will say and we pointed to this earlier in the year is that, we’ve been able to change the relationship that we have with our customers to really drive a lot less seasonality in that business than we had seen before. We saw some, so there were some lines of maintenance that went away during the summer because aircraft are flying, they’ll come back in the fall. But it was much, much less significant than what we had seen in years past. And we’re really pleased that our customers are working with us in this regard, because we want to keep consistent aircraft and consistent workloads throughout the year, so that we can maintain the labor force, but also drive efficiency and the improved margins that you’ve seen.
Josh Sullivan:
And then one on the distribution side, who are you taking share from? Is it larger players or smaller mom-and-pop players? Is there a consolidation in the industry going on that you think it will continue to trend for a while?
John Holmes:
Yeah. Many of the wins that we’ve announced in the last couple of years have come from the larger players. So that would be ADL owned by Boeing, Satair owned by Airbus and then a handful of smaller, but predominantly the larger players.
Josh Sullivan:
Got it. And then just one last one on the Southwest relationship, any movement there, any dynamics there you can talk about or highlight for us?
John Holmes:
The Southwest relationship.
Josh Sullivan:
With the aircraft party now.
John Holmes:
No. Nothing new there. They remain a very large customer of ours and a great partner.
Josh Sullivan:
Got it. Thank you for the time.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. One moment for our next question and that will come from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Steve Strackhouse:
Hi, John and Sean. This is actually Steve Strackhouse on for Ken Herbert.
John Holmes:
Hi. How are you?
Steve Strackhouse:
Good. You’ve talked about the extended green time on engines, I believe. I was just wanting if you could touch a little bit further on the parts business, kind of your expectations for retirement for the rest of this year. Are you starting to see any tick-up or are you starting to build inventory, I know you talked about building inventory, but just about kind of your expectations for the rest of the year?
John Holmes:
Yeah. Generally speaking, the green time, I think, is -- the green time is lasting longer than we would have anticipated. And the pilot shortage is definitely contributing to that in as much as you’ve got a number of aircraft that are on the ground, because airlines don’t have pilots. I was with one of our larger customers earlier this week and they shared with me that at the moment they’ve got 50 aircraft on the ground as a result of pilot shortages. Well, that’s 100 engines that they now have access to, to swap around and burn off screen time. So that’s definitely persisting longer than we would have imagined. As it relates to overall supply, I would say, nothing structural has changed. There’s still plenty of demand and plenty of tightness out there in terms of used material supply. But we have, as we mentioned and you saw it, in terms of putting out some cash this quarter, we have found some unique opportunities and we were able to move very quickly and capture material. And that’s good for us, but I wouldn’t say that, it’s an indicator of anything larger going on in the market.
Steve Strackhouse:
Thank you for that. That’s great color there. And then just one more, if I may, the inventories and contract assets for USAFE about $40 million in cash in the quarter, and then going back to Q4, it looks like it was about an additional $20 million there as well. Can you just kind of talk about when you think that might normalize for this year and then just kind of free cash flow for patients on the year as well?
Sean Gillen:
Yeah. I think some of it on the contract assets, we had some activity on our longer term programs that weren’t invoiced yet. I would expect those to get invoiced in the near-term, because I don’t think you’d see that trend continue. On inventory and rotable assets, generally, as we talked about, we see opportunities, specifically on parts supply, which would show up in inventory to procure USM material or to win new distribution business that would come with an upfront inventory buy. And then rotables will just support our PBH programs that are recovering and continue to recover with miles flown across the globe.
Steve Strackhouse:
Thanks so much. I will hop back in the queue.
Operator:
Thank you. And we do have a follow-up question and that will come from the line of Mike Ciarmoli with Truist. Please go ahead.
Mike Ciarmoli:
Hey, guys. Thanks. Sean, I know you went through this, I just wanted to make sure I had it, obviously, the year-over-year decline in Government Defense, Afghanistan, but I think you also mentioned the sequential it was down significantly, I guess, 17% or so. Did you say that was just some U.S. programs? I think I missed that. Just what was the driver there and then I know you…
Sean Gillen:
Two-fold [ph].
Mike Ciarmoli:
… for some strengthening as new programs kick in.
Sean Gillen:
Sequentially was two-fold, which was some lower activity on some of the shorter term programs that we’ve won over the last couple of quarters, as well as reduced parts activity sales to the U.S. Government. We had a pretty strong Q4 and just a lighter Q1.
Mike Ciarmoli:
Okay. Okay. Perfect. I mean is that -- is anything related to that reduced activity on the parts sales? Presumably, there’s not much in the way of U.S. op tempo going on or any color you have there, I mean, just something that usually ebbs and flows?
Sean Gillen:
Mostly ebbs and flows, just a strong finish to our…
Mike Ciarmoli:
Okay.
Sean Gillen:
… fiscal Q4.
Mike Ciarmoli:
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Got it. Perfect. Thanks guys.
Operator:
Thank you. And I’m showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
John Holmes:
I appreciate that. We want to thank everybody for your time and your interest, and we look forward to being back next quarter.

Operator:
Good Day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AAR Corp. Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to AAR. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Company Representative:
Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal '22 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. We're joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, these statements are no guarantee of future performance. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in the company's earnings release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, and Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2022. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. Certain non-GAAP financial information will be discussed on the call today. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is set forth in the company's earnings release. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2022 results. Before I comment on the results, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the last fiscal year. We entered the year with optimism that the increasing demand for domestic leisure travel we saw in early summer last year would be a leading indicator for business and international travel. Shortly thereafter, the Delta and Omicron variants emerged and those markets did not rebound at nearly the same rate. In addition, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan as well as the natural conclusion of certain of other of our government programs, created headwinds in our government business, which had been an important source of strength during the pandemic. Finally, in the macro environment, labor has been in short supply, inflation has been running high, and there is uncertainty about economic growth. In light of this backdrop, I'm incredibly proud of the results that we delivered this year. It was not inevitable that AAR would be able to navigate the pandemic in the way that we have. And that's a credit to our team for finding a way and to our customers for recognizing the value that we deliver and I want to thank them both. Turning to the results for the full year. Sales increased 10% from $1.65 billion to $1.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 82% from $1.31 per share to $2.38 per share. We were able to more than offset a 13% decline in sales to the government customers with a 34% increase in sales to commercial customers. Even more importantly, we were able to continue to drive efficiency improvements and cost discipline to deliver significant earnings growth. For the quarter, sales were up 9% from $438 million to $476 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 53% from $0.47 per share to $0.72 per share. Our sales to commercial customers increased 28% and our sales to government and defense customers decreased 13%. Sequentially, our total sales growth was 5% and our adjusted EPS growth of 14%. Our operating margin was 7% for the quarter on an adjusted basis, up from 5.2% last year and 6.7% in the third quarter. We continue to see strong performance in our MRO operations as our hangers remain nearly full, and we continue to benefit from the efficiency initiatives that we implemented across the company during the pandemic. In our parts activities, we saw further recovery in the quarter but demand remains inconsistent and the availability of used serviceable material to support our trading operations remains in short supply for certain platforms. Turning to our government business. While we saw a decrease in revenue, it is important to note that despite this decline, we were able to expand margins during the quarter. Just taking a step back, I would like to highlight that in this quarter, we delivered adjusted operating margin and EPS that exceeded pre-COVID levels, despite our sales being down 15% from their pre-COVID high. This was a goal we established early in the pandemic, and I'm proud of the work we've done to deliver against that commitment. Regarding cash flow, it was another strong quarter as we generated $40.2 million from operating activities from continuing operations. We also repurchased $22 million of stock in the quarter under our share repurchase program. Even after the share repurchase, we reduced our net debt leverage to 0.3x EBITDA, and we continue to be exceptionally well positioned to fund our growth. Turning to new business. During the quarter, we announced a marketing partnership with ProvenAir Technologies which has developed a digital solution that uses proprietary algorithms to analyze and dynamically generate back-to-birth trade history for aircraft parts. This is a capability that we are using in our own operations and this partnership allows us to bring this emerging digital solution to our customers as well. In addition, we announced our relationship with Aero Design Labs, which is a company that has developed an aerodynamic drag reduction system kit for the 737NG. This kit has the potential to reduce fuel burn by 1.5% for the 737-700, which equates to over 40 tons of CO2 reduction per aircraft per month and the benefits are expected to be even larger of the 737-800 and 737-900. We will be providing distribution services to the company on an exclusive basis and have also invested in the company to help fund its growth. Finally, earlier this week, we announced that we became the first non-OEM to be awarded the Captains of Industry contract by the Defense Logistics Agency. This is a distinction that establishes a long-term strategic supply chain relationship with the U.S. Department of Defense and will provide us with access to unique opportunities to support the U.S. and its allies. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Sean Gillen, to result -- to give us results in more detail.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $476.1 million were up 8.8% or $38.5 million year-over-year. Sales in our Aviation Services segment were up 9%, driven by the recovery in our commercial business, and sales in our Expeditionary Services segment were up 4.5%. Overall, our commercial sales were up 28% year-over-year, while our government sales were down 13%, driven by the wind down of our activity in Afghanistan and the natural completion of other government programs. Sequentially, our commercial sales increased 11%, and our government sales decreased 3%. Gross profit margin in the quarter was 18.9% versus 16.4% in the prior year quarter, and adjusted gross profit margin was 18.6% versus 16.5% in the prior year quarter. Gross profit margin in our commercial business was 17.7% and gross profit margin in our government business was 20.8%. The government margin was driven by continued strong performance as well as certain contract modifications, which resulted in higher recovery on indirect costs. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $56.9 million. This figure includes increased investments in our digital initiatives as well as $2.9 million related to investigation and remediation matters and strategic project costs. As a reminder, our fourth quarter has historically been our seasonally highest SG&A quarter, and we remain committed to driving SG&A down as a percentage of sales while continuing to invest in our cost. Net interest expense for the quarter was $0.6 million compared to $0.9 million last year, driven by lower borrowings despite the increase in interest rates. As John indicated, we generated cash flow from our operating activities from continuing operations of $40.2 million. In addition, we funded $22.2 million of share repurchase and reduced our accounts receivable financing program by $3 million. Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with net debt of $46.5 million and net leverage of only 0.3x. Consistent with the last 2 quarters, we expect to continue to execute on our plan to deploy the full $150 million share repurchase authorization over approximately 2 years from the time of announcement. Thank you for your attention. And I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. Looking forward, while demand for domestic and European commercial travel continues to be very strong, global traffic recovery in total continues to be slower, and we are paying attention to the macroeconomic environment and its potential impact on the market for air travel. For us, commercial parts demand should generally track the recovery in commercial flying. Within commercial parts activities, the growth of our used parts sales will also be impacted by the availability of supply, which remains tight for certain platforms while the growth in our new part sales should continue to benefit from the new distributorships we have won recently and those that remain in our pipeline. Demand for MRO remains strong, and we expect the hangers to remain largely full throughout this fiscal year. In our government business in the coming quarters, we expect growth to return as recent program wins ramp up and as we convert opportunities from our strong pipeline. With respect to Q1 specifically, as you know, historically, Q1 has been a down quarter sequentially from Q4, and we expect that to be the case this year. We also expect to make investments in our business in the near term as we prepare for additional commercial parts demand as well as to potentially fund inorganic growth. For full year FY '23, given that the trajectory of the commercial aviation market recovery remains difficult to predict, exacerbated by increasing macroeconomic uncertainty, we are going to continue our recent practice of not providing formal guidance. Having said that, based on what we can see today, we expect sequential quarterly growth to return beginning in Q2, and we will continue to provide updates as we move through the year. Over the longer term, we remain exceptionally well positioned. Our unique independent Aviation Services business model continues to resonate with both commercial and government customers. Our end markets are growing, and we have the balance sheet strength to fund our continued expansion. I'm excited about all of the opportunities we have ahead of us, and the team and I remain committed to delivering value for our shareholders. Before we take questions, I want to take a few moments to recognize our Chairman, David Storch. We announced yesterday that David has chosen to retire from the Board effective in January. David started at AAR in 1978 and served as its CEO from 1996 until 2018. During that time, he more than quadrupled the company's sales while navigating numerous peaks and valleys in the aviation industry, including both 9/11 and the great financial crisis. Even more importantly, he established and modeled the doing-it-right approach, which is the culture we continue to live by, and set the foundation for the company to be the pillar of strength and opportunity than it is today. I congratulate David on his retirement and thank him for his leadership, counsel and friendship. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC.
Kenneth Herbert:
John, I appreciate the commentary on sort of the full year '23 outlook and, I guess, lack of visibility. But can you help at all or provide any more granularity on the commercial business? You said MRO is largely full. So it sounds like that business is maybe flat to up slightly, but what's the growth expectation specifically on the parts side in fiscal '23, if you could provide any more detail around that?
John Holmes:
Yes. You've got it right on the MRO side. From what we see today, the hangers are largely full, and we expect continued strong demand throughout the year in heavy maintenance. On the parts side, the distribution business, the commercial distribution business, continues to grow, and that's largely driven by the new wins that we've announced in the last 18 months as they come online. So we expect growth in the new business, in the new parts business as a result of those wins. In the used parts business, it's more of an inconsistent story. We saw quite a bit of accelerated demand through Q3 as well as through most of Q4. That demand has moderated a bit as we're in the first quarter of this year. The other factor you've got going on there is we see very strong demand in certain platforms. But as a result, there's also a lot of demand for material and that's in tight supply. And so with certain platforms where we see strong and consistent demand it's a little bit more challenging to find the used material to service that demand. So -- in summary, I feel very good about MRO, feeling good about the continued recovery and growth in commercial parts distribution but a bit of an uneven story in trading based on the factors I just described.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. That's helpful. And you've got a, obviously, very low leverage. It sounds like from your commentary that there might be some investment opportunities you're looking at -- you've talked in the past about attractiveness of PMA. Is that something you're continuing to look at? And organically, are there -- is there an expectation that there's significant opportunities to invest in either engines or airframe or other feedstock as you think about the surplus marketplace here in the near term?
John Holmes:
Yes. Great question. So -- in terms of feedstock and the trading business, that's one of our greatest strengths right now is our balance sheet capacity and our ability to move very quickly and outmaneuver the competition when packages or material become available. And we are in the market all day, every day, around the world looking for the right material. And when we find it, we're able to close very, very quickly. So that will definitely be a source of capital deployment for us throughout the year. As it relates to PMA and other initiatives specifically, we do have organic PMA efforts underway, and we're encouraged by the progress there. It's early and it's slow growing, but we do have a nice team focused on organic PMA efforts. And as we've indicated in the past, we will continue to look at inorganic opportunities to bolster that effort if assets become available and we can get valuation, et cetera, to align with expectations.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. That's great. And if I could just -- one final question. As I look at then the investments, you had some nice growth in cash from obviously '21 through '22. How do we think about -- and you've got a lot of money tied up in working capital. So how do we think about free cash in '23 on top of just the growth in income? Is working capital maybe some opportunity to unlock some cash there? Or do we see limited growth of '22?
John Holmes:
Yes. We're really proud of the consistent cash flow that we've been able to generate, and that goes along with the consistent margin improvement, et cetera, that we've been able to drive in the business overall. We certainly expect to be cash flow positive again this year, and our goal is to remain consistent in terms of cash flow generation. Having said that, though, just going back to your prior question, if we see an opportunity to make a great purchase of hot engine material or feedstock to serve other parts of the trading business, we're going to deploy that cash and deploy it quickly. And again, that's an advantage of the market. So while the goal, overall, is to continue to generate cash and continue to be more efficient with our working capital, we want to remain flexible so that we can react to market opportunities.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with Benchmark.
Joshua Sullivan:
Just on that comment there, the uneven story in the parts business, I think you said you saw an acceleration in Q3, Q4, then a moderation here. Is there any dichotomy you can identify between narrow-body and wide-body just as some of those markets come back here?
John Holmes:
Yes. I'd say the unevenness is a bit from the -- is more from the narrow-body. Our wide-body business in trading is largely to support the cargo market. And that's been consistent throughout the pandemic and very, very strong. And those are the areas where we find the tightness in the supply of material.
Joshua Sullivan:
And then just as far as the CFM56 relationship with Fortress, how is that performing? You mentioned hot section opportunities there? Do you see volumes picking up there, going forward?
John Holmes:
Yes, that's a great question. That partnership continues to go extremely well. That has been a great source of material for us to serve that narrow-body market and Fortress is doing a really fine job on delivering the commitments to material to us that they made at the beginning of the agreement. I mean, at this point, it's fully ramped up. And we continue to work with Fortress as they expand their business and their engine portfolio, we could see growth in that platform. But at this point, it's operating at full capacity and at the level we expected.
Joshua Sullivan:
And then just on the investments you made in your labor pool throughout COVID. How much runway do you think you have before you need to reinvest? Or what level of traffic would you need to see where you said capacity?
John Holmes:
On the -- in the MRO business?
Joshua Sullivan:
Yes. Yes. I mean just in the great investments you guys made in keeping your count around how much capacity that is there.
John Holmes:
Yes. So we -- again, thanks for highlighting that. I mean we're really proud of the way we held together the team through COVID, and that has served us very, very well. And it wasn't just holding the existing team, it was maintaining the partnerships that we form with schools over time. We continue to fund those partnerships, and we continue to get results in terms of, I would say, a proprietary source of talent with these relationships we have with the schools to support the MRO business. In certain markets, our capacity is limited by our ability to hire. And in other markets, our capacity is limited by Foursquare. In the markets where we're limited by Foursquare , we are considering opportunities to expand our footprint, where we know we've got supply of labor, and we know we're going to have longer customer interest. So at this point, when we say the hangers are full, we mean full both in terms of footprint as well as labor availability. But as we move forward, we're going to again focus on some targeted expansion to look for ways to grow that business domestically.
Operator:
We have a follow-up from Ken Herbert with RBC.
Kenneth Herbert:
John, what should we assume for any kind of labor rate relief you might be getting in the MRO business in fiscal '23, considering the inflated labor costs?
John Holmes:
Yes. Our goal right now is to preserve the margin gains that we have made. We've seen a lot of improvement in efficiency in that business over the last 18 months, and we want to hold on to that. So as we see increasing labor costs, that is driving any discussions we're having with the customer about price adjustments. But the goal there is to preserve the spot that we're in. That has been a very dynamic environment over the last 3 or 4 quarters. I think we've mentioned that our customers, as you've heard from them, they're seeing the exact same labor pressures we are. And so they recognize the value that we bring and the service that we provide to them and the need for us to be profitable and to be able to attract talent. So it's a challenging environment for everybody. But so far, we've been very pleased with the support we've gotten from the customer on the need to change prices to address rising labor costs.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. That's helpful. And in the past, you've talked about the need to see a sort of a more material inflection in demand for surplus material in the revenues associated with the surplus parts market to really see a step change in the margin profile. It sounds like, from your comments, that we're maybe not there, at least in the first half of fiscal '23. What should we be watching out in order to maybe get a little bit of visibility on that margin step change? And barring that, how should we think about the margin progression for fiscal '23?
John Holmes:
Sure. So again, very proud of the progress that we made over the last 7 quarters on operating margin improvement. And as you know, we're now well exceeding, particularly with this configuration of businesses, well exceeding the margins that we had pre-COVID. As we see the parts business recover, and you're right, we're not at that inflection point yet where we'll see a meaningful step up from where we are as we see that parts business recover and the overall revenue mix shift towards the parts businesses, we would see further margin expansion. At this point, it's difficult to predict the trajectory of that. As you highlighted, I don't think we'll see that meaningful step change in the first half of the year. But as the supply chain issues or labor issues get worked out in the system and airlines can service the demand that they see and flying increases, we would expect parts business to pick up in the second half of the year. Just to quantify that, our -- both in the trading and commercial parts distribution, overall down still about 20% from where we were pre-COVID. That compares to roughly 25% from where we were in Q3. So we have seen a modest improvement there, which contributed partially to the sequential margin improvement that we saw this quarter. But given we're still 20% off of pre-COVID levels, we've got a ways to go in that business. And again, that would help margins throughout next year or this year.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist.
Michael Ciarmoli:
John, just on '23, I know you're not going to give the guidance, but if we went back to last quarter, you talked about this inflection, a more meaningful inflection in '23. Should we still be thinking about that? And I guess, if I look at -- I mean, you just gave where we were on parts, but are we thinking that a return to peak commercial revenues occurs this year? Or -- I guess, how do you see '23? Should we still think about that meaningful inflection? Or how should we calibrate our expectations here?
John Holmes:
Yes. I think -- great question. I go back to the prior comments in as much as we still see the potential for that, I think at this point, it's a second half discussion as opposed to a first half discussion. And when we talk about getting back to pre-COVID peak revenues, keep in mind, we structurally took out revenue from the company from activities that weren't profitable or were unprofitable. And so really, in terms of getting back to pre-COVID levels, we're talking about parts businesses. And that's that kind of 20% off that I just described.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Got it. What -- as we think -- you said more second half -- and I mean, obviously, we're seeing the results from the airlines now. And I think if we looked at outside repairs by Delta, United, these guys are all spending significantly. What's sort of the dialogue? You mentioned that the hangers are going to be full. I mean, I think we're all looking at potential global economic slowdown. Are you seeing any or hearing anything different from your customers about how they're thinking about their longer-term planning for their fleets? Certainly, it doesn't seem like there's any potential pullback in maintenance at this point, but any kind of color you're getting from the airlines as they think about their longer-term planning?
John Holmes:
I think, overall, the airlines remain bullish on the return of demand. And we believe that the current generation of fleet based on what we're hearing, which is the fleet that we're predominantly involved in endorsing is still going to be around for longer than people initially expected. So that bodes well for us. I think the challenge for the customers -- for our customers right now is really, as you've heard from them, it's driven by the staffing challenges that the airports themselves, pilot shortages, which have caused them to have to cancel flights and fly less. That's really their focus. But overall demand for air travel that we're hearing from our customers still remains very, very strong. It's just about getting the system back up fully running, so that we can actually support that demand. And so again, while we're kind of in a bit of an uneven period here, we still feel really good about that return of the parts business and the fact that the platforms in which we operate and perform maintenance on that they're going to be around for a long time.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just 1 last one. You mentioned -- and you've had a press release, I believe, out on it. The Aero Design Labs, I mean you actually said you made some investment there. And if I go back, and I don't know, it's maybe 15 years or so, they're kind of comparing this to winglets and the opportunity that, that presented, which really significant for a lot of the aftermarket players. So I mean, do you see the same potential in the 737 drag kit? I mean is that -- and maybe if you could just elaborate on the investment you made in sort of how you guys are thinking about the model for revenues and sort of the opportunity there for these kind of retrofits, if you would?
John Holmes:
Yes, I think you've hit it on the head. I would definitely say that this is analogous to winglets. We're excited that they announced the STC on the 737-700, and we know they're working on the same for the 737-800 and 737-900, which obviously is a very large fleet. And given the price of fuel today, we expect that the airline community interest will be extremely strong in this solution. We were really happy to get -- to start this partnership very early with ADL. We've actually been working with them for some time. And we have increased our investment in the company over that period of time. So we're very bullish, both from an investment standpoint but also as it relates to the exclusive agreement that we've got in place to distribute the kits as they're developed and produced.
Operator:
And I'm showing no other questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to AAR for closing remarks.
John Holmes:
Great. Once again, I really appreciate everybody's time and interest in the support and we look forward to reporting on our first quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator:
This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Dylan Wolin:
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to ARR's Fiscal 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, these statements are no guarantee of future performance. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in the company's earnings release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31st, 2021 and Form 10-Q of the fiscal quarter ended November 30th, 2021. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. Certain non-GAAP financial information will be discussed on the call today. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is set forth in the company's earnings release. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you and good afternoon everyone. I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2022 results. I want to start by saying that our thoughts are with those impacted by the conflict in Ukraine. We are both saddened and angered by Russia's unprovoked invasion and stand with all those who are suffering. Although we do very little work in either country, we have suspended all of our business with the sanctioned nations and territories. That said and turning to the quarter, our sales increased 10% year-over-year from $410 million to $452 million and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 70% from $0.37 per share to $0.63 per share. Sequentially overall sales grew 3.6%. In our commercial business, we had another strong quarter in MRO. Our parts activity started out slowly in the quarter, but gained momentum as the impact of the Omicron variant declined. As we have discussed previously, parts supply is our highest margin activity and its recovery is paced behind MRO. The parts momentum during the quarter gives us continued confidence in the eventual full recovery and ultimately, more growth out of that activity. On the government side, we were able to drive sequential growth despite the headwinds we faced as a result of the Afghanistan withdrawal. Regarding earnings, I'm particularly pleased that we delivered another quarter of margin expansion as our adjusted operating margin was 6.7%. Sequentially, this is up from 6.1% in the second quarter and continued to exceed pre-COVID levels despite our commercial sales remaining down more than 25%. Turning to cash, we had another excellent quarter as we generated $16 million of cash from operating activities from continuing operations. We also repurchased $20 million of stock consistent with the share repurchase program we announced earlier in the quarter. Even after the share repurchases our balance sheet remains strong at 0.4 times net leverage and we continue to be exceptionally well-positioned to fund our growth. Regarding new business during the quarter we announced a 10-year renewal of our component MRO contract to provide depot-level maintenance for NATO's E-3A AWACS aircraft. Also subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced a new exclusive distribution agreement with Collins Aerospace to supply de-icers and supporting products to the global aftermarket. This is an important win because it's our first exclusive commercial distribution agreement with Collins and it also represents a move into the business jet market where we see adjacent opportunities for growth. This most recent distribution win demonstrates both the value proposition that our offering brings to component OEMs and our ability to drive market share gains in this activity. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO Sean Gillen to discuss the quarter in more detail.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $452.2 million were up 10.2% or $41.9 million year-over-year. Sales in our Aviation Services segment were up 12.4%, driven by recovery in our commercial markets and sales in our Expeditionary Services segment were down $6.4 million driven by a delayed pallet order that we expect to now receive in Q4. Our commercial sales were up 28% year-over-year, while our government sales were down 8%. The decline in government sales was primarily driven by the wind down of our activity in Afghanistan and the natural completion of other government programs. Our sales in Afghanistan in the quarter were $8 million and we currently expect to be down to approximately $1 million in the fourth quarter. Sequentially, our commercial sales increased 2.8% and our government sales increased 4.6%. Our MRO operations remained near capacity. And although we saw increasing parts volumes throughout the quarter overall parts growth was limited by the slower start that John referenced. On the government side, the sequential sales growth was driven by our ability to secure additional work in our government program's operations which was more than sufficient to offset the reduction of activity in Afghanistan. Gross profit margin in the quarter was 17.8% versus 21% in the prior year quarter, which included the benefit of CARES Act payroll support. Adjusted gross profit margin was 17.3% up from 16.1% in the prior year quarter and 16.7% in Q2. This margin expansion continues to be driven by the efficiency improvement and portfolio refinement actions that we took during the pandemic as well as improved conditions in our commercial parts activities. Gross profit margin in our commercial business was 20.1% and gross profit margin in our government business was 14.5%. In the quarter commercials margin benefited from intercompany procurement activity on behalf of government customers. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $48.9 million or 10.8% of sales. Excluding adjustments of $1.7 million related primarily to investigation and remediation costs this would have been closer to 10.4% of sales. Net interest expense for the quarter was $0.6 million compared to $1 million last year driven by lower borrowings. Average diluted share count for the quarter was 35.7 million. This reflects the repurchase of 0.5 million shares during the quarter. We expect to continue to execute our previously committed plan to deploy the full $150 million authorization over approximately two years. As John indicated, we generated cash flow from our operating activities from continuing operations of $16.2 million and we also reduced our accounts receivable financing program by $2.2 million in the quarter. This strong cash flow largely funded the $20 million share repurchase in the quarter and our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with net debt of $63.9 million and net leverage of 0.4 times. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. Regarding the environment as I indicated earlier we do not have meaningful sales in either Russia or Ukraine and so are not currently experiencing any notable business impact as a result of that conflict. However, we are certainly aware of the related increase in fuel prices and are monitoring the potential impact to our airline customers' operating costs. Domestically, we are continuing to observe tightness in the labor market. And our attrition levels particularly in the hangars have been higher than they were before the pandemic. However, we are fortunate that we took aggressive action beginning in 2019 to address our labor supply when we had started to experience labor shortages at that time. To-date those actions have allowed us to manage through the current environment more effectively than much of our competition and our customers continue to be supportive of moves that we need to make to navigate this tight labor market. With respect to commercial demand our largest North American and European commercial customers remain optimistic about the recovery of demand in the business and leisure travel market and we saw this translate into accelerating parts volume throughout the quarter. This increasing demand is encouraging. And as a result, we expect to see continued recovery in our parts activities over the next several quarters. In the immediate term, we expect modest sales growth sequentially in Q4 and a more meaningful inflection in our FY 2023. Having said that, we recognize that we remain in a dynamic environment and new developments with respect to COVID may continue to impact this trajectory. Regarding margins, this quarter is a good representation of the full impact of the margin improvement actions we took during the pandemic and the potential for further expansion will depend on the mix and taste of the recovery. Early in the pandemic, we took a series of actions to drive operating efficiency and balance sheet strength with a goal towards achieving higher margins even without a full recovery in sales. I'm extremely proud that we have delivered on that plan. We have now expanded operating margins for six straight quarters and we're one of the very few companies in commercial aerospace with a stronger balance sheet than we had prior to the pandemic. Our performance has positioned us to invest in our business both organically and inorganically and continue to deliver value for our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. With that I will turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from RCBC [ph]. Your line is open.
Ken Herbert:
Hey, good afternoon, John and Sean.
John Holmes:
Hey, Ken.
Ken Herbert:
John I just wanted to start off. The up 28% in Aviation in the quarter, can you just talk about the relative performance of MRO relative to the parts businesses?
John Holmes:
Sure. Both of those were actually consistent with what we saw in Q3. So in the parts business as we indicated, we got off to a slower start, we saw volumes a bit down early in the quarter, which we assume was related to pullback from the Omicron variant – as a result of the Omicron variant. And then throughout the quarter as the impact of that variant subsided, we saw accelerating parts volumes that ultimately and that's continued through today, ultimately were higher than what we saw in Q2. But net-net parts was about even quarter-over-quarter. The MRO business was consistent from Q2 to Q3. Again, the hangars there remain largely full and we're really happy with the performance there. The growth though quarter-over-quarter sequentially came from other areas of the commercial business. We saw a recovery in our commercial programs business. So our customers in that area started to fly more hours, which translated to more revenue, given the nature of the PBH program. And then we saw other strong performance in other areas of the MRO business out of component repair as well as our landing gear operation.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. That's helpful. And if I could on the aerospace side. Can you just dig a little bit deeper into the potential risk to the business and the recovery from higher crude prices or fuel prices for your airline customers? I know on the one hand, it would obviously support usage of newer assets, which might create more USM feedstock. But obviously, on the other hand there's clearly just a risk to sort of the balance sheet and the operating model. So can you talk through your expectations of how that could impact your business over the next few quarters?
John Holmes:
Yes. Sure. And I think you highlighted, you've got a few different competing dynamics there. Certainly, it's a situation we're monitoring. And it's a situation that AAR has seen many times over the decades that we've been in the industry. I would say, that this is a pretty meaningful -- a function of how much of the fuel price increases the airlines are ultimately able to pass on to the consumer. We talk to lots of our customers and those varying views on, how much of that will be able to be passed on. So that's a factor, that ultimately drives how they think about their expenses. But we are -- as we think about the customers' operating costs and to the extent that they see sustained increases, it's going to drive them to lower-cost solutions and we are a lower cost solution.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. That's helpful. Just finally, if I could maybe for Sean. I mean the balance sheet you could argue is significantly underutilized now as we continue to see some recovery on the commercial side. How are you thinking about capital allocation and other opportunities, or do you feel like you should maybe put a little bit more onto the balance sheet as you think about accelerating growth in any areas?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. Good question. And I think the capital allocation priorities remain the same. We do see increasing opportunity, to invest organically and specifically in the Parts business. So inventory has been providing cash over the past several quarters. And I think, that we're seeing opportunity on new business wins in distribution as well as procurement activity and used serviceable material to invest in that. I think there continues to be inorganic opportunity via acquisition. So that will be -- we think that could be an area for us to allocate capital. And then repurchase, we did $20 million in the quarter, so got a good start to the new repurchase and we'll continue to look to put money to work there. But I think, that the balance sheet as you say is, arguably underlevered but we do think we have adequate and full opportunity to put money to work.
Ken Herbert:
Great. All right. Well, thank you very much.
John Holmes:
Thank you, Ken.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from Truist. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hi, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and nice results. Maybe, John just to go back to Ken's line of questioning on fuel. I mean, can you specifically indicate or tell us are you seeing any behavioral changes from your customers at this point, yet, in terms of, whether it's spending on discretionary upgrades, or are they planning on doing maintenance visits or heavy visits on older planes that they're now thinking with this current fuel environment it might be better to retire those planes? Are you seeing any of that yet or having discussions with them around that?
John Holmes:
Great question. And the answer is really, no. It's certainly top of mind for everybody but the overriding conversation with our customer base right now and again I'm focusing on North America and Europe, is really around being prepared for what our airline customers see as a very strong spring and summer. And the other thing we're getting is that, there seems to be I guess a happy surprise around the pace of business travel return. And so the airlines right now are just focused on making sure that they've got enough equipment available and ready to support what they see as a very strong couple of quarters. So that's the headline.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. Got it. No that's a good segue, too because I wanted to -- I mean the fiscal fourth quarter is usually seasonally your strongest. I think in some of your prepared comments, you kind of said you expect -- I think you were just talking about Parts continuing to recover with modest growth in the fourth quarter. But what about the entire business? Should we expect that pretty steep sequential increase 3Q to 4Q? And then, even if you can maybe give us some directional color on how to think about next year in this sort of uneven time with COVID, do we expect that normal pullback in the fiscal first quarter, or just given kind of the environment do you think revenue growth keeps building sequentially?
John Holmes:
Yeah, I think – again, good question. So the comment related to overall modest improvement from Q3 to Q4 that was meant to be an overall sales modest increase from Q3 to Q4.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay.
John Holmes:
And you've got a few different parts in there. You've got MRO, which we expect to have another strong quarter in MRO. And then you have continued momentum in the parts business. But also, we haven't talked a lot about government yet, but in government this will be another quarter of feeling the full impact of the withdrawal from Afghanistan as well as the other – the natural completion of some of the other government programs. And so there's a lot of work that we need to do on the government side to make up for that, while we are – I won't say waiting, but focused on other longer-term government programs like the safety contract kicking in that will ultimately replace the lost revenue of Afghanistan. So again we're thinking about stronger performance out of commercial, but government is a bit of a mix at the moment, while we're in transition between the wind-down from Afghanistan, and the ramp-up of other long-term programs. And then thinking about next year, I think we mentioned that we're expecting modest improvement overall from Q3 to Q4, but a more meaningful inflection results as we get into our next fiscal year. And hopefully, COVID is further and further in the rearview mirror. And as it relates to the first quarter specifically, the biggest seasonal driver there is typically our MRO business. And at this point, we expect – and again all of this is subject to a dynamic environment, but at this point we expect another strong summer as airlines continue to get aircraft ready to support recovery in demand.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. Okay. Got it. Just a quick one on government. Are there – given what's going on with Russia and Ukraine, are there any opportunities for you guys? I know, the WASS contract covers a lot of those Eastern European countries. I mean, are you seeing indications that you could see a scope increase there or increased revenues as a result of I'll call it increased op tempo over there?
John Holmes:
Yeah. I'd say, again, another good question. I think there's really three areas that Ukraine could – that that situation could provide positive tailwind for us. One is, we saw a pretty meaningful decline in our day-to-day parts business with the DOA as the new – as the Biden administration shifted priorities from spending on sustaining – shifted priorities from sustaining the current fleet to directing dollars towards the next-generation development. Obviously, given where we are in the world right now, having the current fleet in a better position to be ready to go, it would seem that that would be a priority. And so you could see more sustainment dollars being spent, which would translate into more parts demand for us. We haven't seen that yet, but it's something we could anticipate. The other area is in our mobility business. You could see to the extent that, there's going to be troops moving around the world, you could see elevated demand for the shelters and containers that we manufacture. We have – again, we haven't seen that yet. But if we look over the decades, what typically follows situations like this, we would expect to see some activity there depending on how this unfolds. And the final thing in -- the third area that you touched on is WASS. That is a program that -- a big part of it is flying diplomatic missions. Historically, you've seen Democratic administration such as the one we're in utilize diplomacy more. And so you may see increased tempo out of that program as a result of increased diplomatic activity. And that's another area where we could see positive benefit over time. Again, it's still very early. We haven't seen any meaningful movement in any of these areas. But those are the three key areas I think that could be impacted by a sustained -- a prolonged conflict.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it, very helpful. I’ll jump back in the queue guys. Thanks.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] And we have a follow-up question from Michael Ciarmoli from Truist. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Nobody else jumping on, I figured I'd get back on here. Two other follow-ups, John. You mentioned the tight labor market. Any color about wages and passing those along to your customers and maybe thoughts on how that could impact margins. I mean you sounded pretty confident in the operating margin story. Is that something that could create some headwind?
John Holmes:
Yeah. I think again, a good question. A couple of thoughts there. Yes, to-date we've had very constructive dialogue with our customers where we need to around potential adjustments to contracts to support increases in labor. It's definitely a tight market. As I mentioned, I think we're managing that very well. But it's still very dynamic, and it's something we're paying a lot of attention to. And it varies by market. I mean you might see tightness in one market and therefore, we need to talk about raising wages in one area more than another depending on how recruiting is going. And that in turn drives decisions or conversations with the customers. But so far, they've been supportive. If we think about that as it relates to margin, yes, as labor cost increase and to the extent we cannot pass them fully on to the customer, we could see some margin headwind in the MRO business. But on the flip side, our Parts businesses, which are higher margin than MRO has not fully recovered. We're still down 20% to 25% there. And as we said, given the anticipated continued recovery in the overall industry, we expect those businesses, the parts businesses, the higher-margin businesses to get back to where they were pre-pandemic and ultimately exceed pre-pandemic levels, particularly in our new parts distribution business, because we've signed -- and we just mentioned the Collins agreement, we've signed a number of new distribution agreements over the past two years and those are not yet fully reflected in the results. And the pace of business in commercial parts distribution ultimately will lead to growth as we fully recover. So, again, you've got some competing dynamics there between potential headwinds with labor costs, but then potential tailwinds with growth and recovery in the parts business, which is higher margin.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. And then, last one I had, which is another good segue you mentioned. What created or caused you to finally break through with Collins? I think, you said that was your first win on the distribution side. Was there anything that kind of puts you over the edge there or anything you could point to?
John Holmes:
We've -- thanks for asking that. We have had a coordinated effort with Collins and other large OEMs for some time now. And the value proposition that we represent in the market as the largest independent distributor and I'd say independent, because we're not part of an OEM like Boeing or Airbus, that's gaining some traction. And as you've seen, we've had a steady drumbeat of meaningful wins over the last several years and that's starting to get noticed. And the other thing I would say is that, our sales force, our team really focuses on becoming technically proficient in our OEM partners' parts. And our goal is to go out there and help the OEMs that we partner with on an exclusive basis displace competitive product. So we're not a call center. We're not just holding inventory waiting for a call. We're out there as a true extension of our partners. And we think that's a unique model in the industry. And again, it's getting some traction with the larger players like Collins.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Helpful. All right. Thanks guys.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Mike.
Operator:
And we have another follow-up question from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC [ph]. Your line is open.
Ken Herbert:
Hey, John, just a quick question. It sounds like the commentary you're pretty confident and optimistic about, a positive inflection in 2023 Aerospace sales, if I heard you correctly. Is that correlated with maybe an inflection you're expecting to see on the parts side and surplus material in particular, or can you provide any more sort of commentary as to what's behind that expected step-up in 2023?
John Holmes:
Yes. And, again -- so, yes, it's largely driven by our expectation around parts. We've been encouraged by the recovery in demand that we've seen of late, provided that, we don't get some other curveball thrown at us as an industry by COVID. We think that trend is going to continue. And going back to what I said earlier, given the fact that the parts businesses are still 20% to 25% down, there's room to run there just out of recovery. And then, given the fact that, we've won new lines like Collins in distribution, as those lines mature and older lines recover we've kind of got built-in growth there based on the business we've signed up. So, we feel good. I would expect that -- so that's where we would look for the growth to come from. And then, I would just go back to, on the MRO side the hangars are full. We're performing well. And we're in a good spot there. But I was expecting a relatively stable performance out of MRO on the commercial side, given where we are in capacity.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. And then given the mix shift it sounds like in 2023 potentially with greater growth on the parts side relative to MRO, how should we think about incremental margins? It sounds clearly like your sort of the cost story near-term has run its course. And we need to see volume to really drive margins. But what kind of incrementals should we think about for models, as you see that mix benefit in 2023?
John Holmes:
Yeah. I think we need to see how that plays out. We feel good about the full impact. We feel really good about the progress that we've made to be in this position ahead of pre-pandemic margins. While sales have not recovered we're very proud of the progress that we've made there. Going forward, I think we need to see how the competing dynamics in terms of the pace of the parts recovery combined with how we address the potential labor cost headwind we need to see how those dynamics play out. But, I would say that, we're very proud of the progress that we've made. And as that unfolds and as the mix plays out, we overtime expect to continue to expand our margins but it's difficult to get more specific than that right now.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.
John Holmes:
Okay.
Operator:

Dylan Wolin:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, these statements are no guarantee of future performance. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in the company's earnings release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, and Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2021. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. Certain non-GAAP financial information will be discussed on the call today. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is set forth in the company's earnings release. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2022 results. Before discussing the results, I would like to comment on the overall environment. As you know, we're now seeing the spread of the Omicron variant, which is resulting in government restrictions that are impacting commercial passenger traffic. While the overall commercial passenger traffic market is recovering, the Delta variant and now the Omicron variant highlight that, that path to full recovery will not be a straight line. Despite this dynamic environment, we have remained focused on our own execution and are proud of the multiple quarters of margin expansion and strong cash flows that we have delivered. Turning to this most recent quarter, our sales increased 8% year-over-year from $404 million to $437 million, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 71% from $0.31 per share to $0.53 per share. Demand for our MRO services has remained strong. Even as our MRO customers deal with changes to the bookings and schedules, they remain focused on keeping the maintenance supply chain running smoothly. Our customers have also been supportive in recent price negotiations as we look to address the tightness in the labor market together. Parts supply, which is our highest margin activity, had stable volumes throughout the quarter albeit down from the levels we saw early in Q1 before the onset of the Delta variant. While overall the supply chain that supports our own operations at AAR is functioning well, we have seen extended turnaround times from some of our repair subcontractors as well as freight delays which did cause some sales to move from Q2 to Q3. Regarding earnings, we delivered another quarter of margin expansion as our adjusted operating margin was 6.1% for the quarter. Sequentially, this is up from 5.5% in the first quarter despite a decline in sales. Even more importantly, our margin exceeded pre-COVID levels even though our top line is still down significantly. To illustrate this, our adjusted margin this quarter increased from 5.6% to 6.1% compared to 2 years ago prior to the pandemic, even though our adjusted revenue was down $127 million over that same period. This year, this quarter's margin performance continues to validate the actions that we have taken over the past 2 years to drive efficiency in our operations, prioritize more profitable offerings, and exit underperforming activities. We expect continued margin expansion as our commercial parts demand fully recovers. Turning to cash. We had another strong quarter as we generated $16 million from operating activities from continuing operations. We also continued to reduce the usage of our accounts receivable financing program. Excluding the impact of the AR program, our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $26 million. Over the last 6 quarters, we have generated a total of $142 million of cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations. Regarding new business, during the quarter, we announced a 5-year renewal of flydubai with flydubai to provide power-by-the-hour component support for its fleet of 33 737NGs. We also announced a sustainability initiative with Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure, under which we will contribute a percentage of all USM sales from our CFM56 partnership to purchase carbon offset credits on behalf of our customers. This initiative both reflects our commitment to helping our customers reduce their carbon footprint and the fact that USM is a low-cost green alternative to purchase the new parts. Finally, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced a 10-year $365 million contract with the U.S. Air Force to provide depot-level maintenance and repairs primarily for the F-16 aircraft based in Europe. We've been supporting F-16 for decades, but this program takes that support to a new level. The complexity and duration of this contract is a meaningful step above our prior F-16 support and will build past performance that allows us to pursue other programs of a similar nature. Before turning it over to Sean, I would like to also comment on the share repurchase program that we announced earlier this afternoon. As we've said before, our priorities for capital allocation are
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $436.6 million were up 8.2% or $33 million year-over-year. Sales in our Aviation Services segment were up 8.9%, driven by recovery in our commercial markets, and sales in our Expeditionary Services segment were down $1.3 million. Our commercial sales were up 33%, while our government sales were down 15%. The decline in government sales was driven primarily by the level of activity on our program for the modification and sale of two C-40 aircraft to the U.S. Marine Corp in the year ago quarter. Sequentially, our commercial sales declined 3.6% due primarily to the impact of the Delta variant on our parts supply activities, and our government sales declined 4.7% driven by the wind-down of certain programs and the reduction of activity in Afghanistan. Gross profit margin in the quarter was 18% versus 17.2% in the prior year quarter, and adjusted gross profit margin was 16.7% versus 13.9% in the prior year quarter. This significant margin expansion was driven by the efficiency improvement and portfolio refinement actions that we have taken and also reflects the benefit of closing out certain contracts in our commercial and government businesses. Gross profit margin in our commercial businesses was 17.3%, and gross profit margin in our government businesses was 18.9%. The adjustments in the quarter apply to both the commercial and government end markets, but were more heavily weighted towards commercial. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $47.1 million or 10.8% of sales. Excluding adjustments of $1.1 million related to severance and investigation and remediation costs, this would have been closer to 10.6% of sales, in line with Q1 despite the decline in sales. SG&A is still approximately $10 million below the pre-COVID amount from Q2 of FY '20. Going forward, we do not expect SG&A to grow in proportion to revenue. As a result, as the commercial demand environment recovers and we continue to win additional government business, we expect to be able to drive SG&A to 10% of sales or lower. Net interest expense for the quarter was $0.4 million compared to $1.3 million last year driven by lower borrowings. Average diluted share count for the quarter was 35.6 million versus 35 million for the prior year quarter. As John indicated, we generated cash flow from our operating activities from continuing operations of $15.9 million and also reduced our accounts receivable financing program by $10 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we repaid our Canadian term loan of $24.7 million using our revolving credit facility, which further simplifies our debt capital structure. Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with net debt of $61.8 million and net leverage of 0.4x. Regarding the share repurchase program, as indicated in our release earlier this afternoon, it's a $150 million authorization to acquire shares at management's discretion during open trading windows, and we intend to fully deploy the authorized amount over approximately the next 2 years. Thank you for your attention, and I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. Turning to the quarter ahead. As of now, the Omicron variant has not impacted our customers' maintenance plans. As such, we expect MRO activities to remain at the current levels, which are near full capacity. Parts supply, which is our most international activity, is more likely to be impacted by the reinstatement of global travel restrictions, which could further extend the time line for full recovery. That said, we expect the impact of each new variant to diminish as we move forward. And although the timing is difficult to predict, parts demand, we expect will eventually return as operators move to restock their inventory. Further, we expect to grow our business beyond just the scope of the recovery, given the incremental interest in USM and as we continue to secure new long-term exclusive distribution agreements. On the government side, the F-16 program demonstrates our commercial best practices, are resonating with the government customer, and our pipeline is full, and we expect to be able to continue to expand our government programs portfolio. Notwithstanding the uncertainty, we feel good about our backlog and parts supply, the loading in our hangars and our government pipeline. As such, we expect to see sequential growth in Q3 with sales approaching the levels we saw in Q1. We are now entering our eighth quarter in a COVID world. We are very pleased with the performance that we've been able to deliver over that time, particularly our margin improvement and our ability to strengthen our balance sheet through consistent cash flow generation. Our launch of $150 million share repurchase program reflects our progress and our confidence, and you can expect continued execution from us over the coming quarters and years. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Your first question as from the line of Ken Herbert of RBC.
Ken Herbert:
I just wanted to start off, the 33% growth in the commercial business, can you -- it sounds like from your commentary that parts supply was maybe down sequentially or maybe not a big driver of that growth. Can you parse out that growth in the quarter from MRO relative to maybe the parts distribution and the parts trading side of the business?
John Holmes:
Yes. It was actually spread fairly evenly. We saw, as we mentioned, at the end of Q4 and at the beginning of Q1, a real uptick in activity in parts in general. And then after Delta took hold, we saw that come down a little bit, but it was relatively stable throughout this quarter, which was up slightly from the prior quarter across both distribution and trading. And MRO was relatively stable, but -- and so most of the growth actually comes from the parts businesses.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. And obviously, we keep getting these new variants and things seem to be pushing to the right in terms of the recovery, but what's your thinking now as to when we might see a more meaningful inflection in either distribution or, I guess more specifically, parts trading? And what are some of the indicators that you're tracking that are going to give you confidence or give you better visibility on when we expect that inflection to occur?
John Holmes:
Well, I think you've gone through a large -- it's a great question. I think you've gone through, in large part, the destocking around the world. And parts demand for narrow-body aircraft, particularly here in North America, has recovered. The areas that we're waiting to see recover are the international markets. And again, parts is our most international business. So once we have clarity on consistent borders being open and travel restrictions being lifted, that's when we would expect to see more continued, more consistent demand in the parts business. And unfortunately, the timing of that is obviously very difficult to predict. But related to that, because you've seen the destocking largely complete and you've seen a preference in the USM -- towards USM material, we believe that once you get more consistent demand as markets fully reopen, there's going to be quite a run on these material because shelves are empty and airlines will have more confidence in consistent flying, so it's difficult to predict when that's going to occur, but we do expect when it does, it will be a pretty meaningful uptick.
Ken Herbert:
And just one final question on that. As you think about the cycle, maybe not just the next few quarters, but the next couple of years, how much do you model or how much do you assume USM demand could outpace broader sort of aftermarket parts demand?
John Holmes:
I wouldn't want to get into specifics on that. But we have seen, both from a market standpoint, I would say international markets such as Asia as well as just legacy carriers here in North America, a significant increase in interest in USM. And so again, it's difficult to predict the path and pace of that growth, but we know that it's there.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from Truist Securities.
Michael Ciarmoli:
John, maybe just on the Omicron variant, I mean, I guess as we look back, Delta and more specifically the response maybe seemed a bit mild versus what we're seeing here now with travel restrictions and everything else going on, how do we -- you said we'll see some growth sequentially back to -- in line with the fiscal first quarter. I mean how do you guys just think about that in response to what you saw with Delta and what we might see here on a go-forward basis with Omicron?
John Holmes:
Yes. Great question. The comments about sequential growth are based largely on -- as I mentioned, we did have some sales slip from Q2 and now will occur in Q3. And so, we're just looking at our backlog across the company, which gives us confidence that you're going to see sequential growth. There's no question, I mean, you said it, the response to Omicron definitely was more rapid and more broad than what you saw with Delta, but we tend to agree with what other airlines have said publicly is that the impact of these -- of each new variant will be shorter as society and as industry and as governments are able to respond more quickly and then hopefully relax restrictions more quickly. Delta was the first example of that. Obviously, we're seeing something -- we're seeing the next generation here with Omicron. But we're hopeful that each one of these cycles, if you will, [indiscerible], the duration will be shorter than the prior. But the comment specifically related to quarter-over-quarter growth are tied to what we see right now in current backlog.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. And what was the amount of revenue that slipped out of the current quarter?
John Holmes :
If you go back to the guidance we provided, we said that it would be between -- this quarter that we would be somewhere between Q4 and Q1. And obviously, we're on the lower end of that. As those products ship as planned, we would have been right in the middle of that guidance.
Michael Ciarmoli :
Okay. Got it. Got it. And then just one more maybe. You kind of mentioned international travel recovering as we think about your parts business, your distribution business. Is there a meaningful difference there in terms of narrow-body, wide-body exposure? I mean do we need to see the widebody utilization maybe not come all the way back, but see some overall improvement? Is that going to be a big driver of some of that parts business for you?
John Holmes :
Some, it will be some. Most of our wide-body exposure in the parts business -- and I should say that we have more wide-body exposure in the trading business than we do in the distribution business. And most of the wide-body exposure in the trading business is cargo-related. There's some commercial, but that's less of an impact. What we're more interested in seeing is more sustained narrow-body travel around the world that would fuel the full recovery of both the parts trading business as well as the parts distribution business.
Operator:
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC.
Ken Herbert:
John, just to follow up on the F-16 contract you announced, how much does that ramp? And how quickly and what's the sort of the fiscal '22 incremental contribution?
John Holmes :
Yes, great question. I would view that as an FY '23 contributor. The ramp-up time for the contract was actually relatively compressed as these things go, but there is the potential that the contract is processed if we were to go through that process. That hasn't happened yet, and we don't have full visibility to that. But once it's clear, we would expect a fairly short ramp. But at this point, we wouldn't expect any meaningful revenue contribution until FY '23.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. Helpful. And on the buyback authorization, I mean, you still identify organic growth and M&A as higher priorities for uses of capital. M&A hasn't been much of a part of the mix for quite a while, and I can appreciate maybe investment opportunities now organically maybe starting to increase but maybe limited as well. How quickly do you expect to ramp on the buyback on the authorization and how much usage there should we expect? Or are there really some nice opportunities in terms of other investments we should be thinking about?
John Holmes :
Yes. Great question. And we -- as we mentioned, the capital allocation priorities are
Ken Herbert:
Okay. That's great. And if I could, just one final clarification. I just wanted to confirm, you indicated that, as a result of Omicron, you haven't seen any change to your MRO schedules or backlogs. I just want to make sure I got that correctly.
John Holmes :
That is correct. That is correct.
Operator:
And again, we have a question from the line of Michael Ciarmoli of Truist Securities.
Michael Ciarmoli :
John, just as we think about labor in a tight labor market, how are you guys feeling? I mean we're going to get through the holidays here pretty quickly and then you're going to probably get into that busy kind of prep summer repair season. I mean it seems like maybe I'm an optimist that airlines globally would probably be looking even more aggressively to a hopefully close to back to normal '22 flying season. Do you feel comfortable with labor as you move into these potentially busy quarters?
John Holmes :
Yes. Again, a great question. And this labor dynamic is something that we're paying an awful lot of attention to. And the short answer to your question is, it's really tight. But because of the initiatives that we -- it's really tight and I would say it is definitely tighter than it was pre-COVID. And I would characterize that as we're seeing pressure not just at the lower -- or not typically the mechanic hourly labor, but for up and down throughout the organization. And so it's a bit of broader base in terms of tightness. But because of the initiatives that we announced pre-COVID and have pursued through COVID, we think we're in a pretty good position. The only thing I would say is that the customers have worked very closely with us to keep the hangars and the loading in the hangars relatively consistent. So what we used to experience with major dips during the summer and significant dips during the holiday season, which resulted in up and down moves in the overall labor force, the customers have worked with us to level load through those periods, which has allowed us to keep the labor force together. And so it's a long answer to your question, but sitting here today, we feel good about the schedule that we have and our ability to meet the schedule and -- but it's a daily focus for us.
Operator:
There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over back to John.
John Holmes :
Great. Well, thank you very much, everybody. We really appreciate the time and the interest, and we wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season. Thank you.
Operator:

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2022 First Quarter Earnings Call. We're joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, these statements are no guarantee of future performance. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in the company's earnings release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 and providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. Certain non-GAAP financial information will be discussed on the call today. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is set forth in the company's earnings release. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great, thank you very much and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2022 results. Our positive momentum continued with another quarter of solid results despite the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the prior year period, sales were up 14% from $401 million to $455 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 206% from $0.17 per share to $0.52 per share. Our sales to commercial customers increased 52% and our sales to government and defense customers decreased 17%. We are particularly pleased that our sequential growth from Q4 to Q1 was 4%, notwithstanding the fact that our first quarter typically declines from our fourth quarter as a result of seasonality in our business. Sequential growth in our commercial activities was 17%. This improvement was driven by our parts businesses, which is an encouraging indicator of returning demand. The strong performance in the quarter was also due to the robust demand for our airframe MRO services. Notably, the significant majority of our MRO volume has been on standard maintenance work as opposed to catch-up work. Our operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter on an adjusted basis, up from 2.5% last year and 5.2% in the fourth quarter. For context, our margin this quarter was actually higher than 2 years ago prior to the pandemic even though our revenue was down $86 million or 16%. This performance demonstrates the operating leverage that we have created over the last 18 months by optimizing our MRO operations, exiting underperforming activities, and reducing indirect and overhead costs. Turning to cash. It was another strong quarter, as we generated $18 million from operating activities from continuing operations. We also continued to reduce the usage of our accounts receivable financing program. Excluding the impact of that AR program, our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operation was $26 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced several new business wins. First, we announced an exclusive agreement with Arkwin, a TransDigm company to distribute engine actuation and other commercial aviation products. This award reflects the power of our independent distribution offering to component OEMs as well as the strength of our balance sheet. Second, we announced a contract with the Department of Energy for the conversion and delivery of a 737-700 aircraft modified to allow the DoE to quickly transition between passenger and cargo modes. Like our prior C40 aircraft delivery contract with the U.S. Marine Corps, this contract demonstrates the significant cost savings available to government customers by procuring in the aftermarket. Finally, we announced an extension of our component support program with Volotea, a growing low-cost Spanish carrier which reflects the market's continued demand for this offering and our ability to drive lower operating costs with superior operating performance. Before turning it over to Sean, I would like to comment on the critical role that AAR played in the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. We had over a 150 people station in the country, primarily in support of our WASS program. Over a 36-hour period, our WASS team transported approximately 2,000 U.S. embassy personnel to Kabul International Airport to support their evacuation from the country. All of our employees subsequently departed the country safely as well, and I'm exceptionally proud of our team support of state department personnel under very difficult circumstances. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Sean Gillen to discuss the quarter in more detail.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $455.1 million were up 14% or $54.3 million year-over-year. Sales in our Aviation Services segment were up 19.8% driven by recovery in our commercial markets. Sales in our Expeditionary Services segment were down $17.7 million, reflecting the divestiture of our Composites business and strong performance of the U.S. Air Force pallet contract in the prior year quarter. Gross profit margin in the quarter was 14.2% versus 12.1% in the prior year quarter and adjusted gross profit margin was 16.1% versus 13% in the prior year quarter. The significant improvement reflects the cost take out and efficiency initiatives we have implemented. As the commercial market recovers, we would expect to continue to generate higher gross margins given the fixed nature of some of our cost of sales and the higher margin nature of our parts business, which has not yet participated in the market recovery to the same degree as our maintenance business. As we indicated during last quarter's call, one of our commercial programs contracts was terminated during the quarter. We recognized $10 million of charges, primarily related to this termination and an asset impairment. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $49.3 million or 10.8% of sales. Excluding severance of about $1 million, this would have been closer to 10.6% of sales. This is down from 11.3% in the year ago quarter and 11.2% in Q4. As a reminder, last year's results had contemporary cost savings due to salary and benefit reductions that were in place through Q2 of last year. Net interest expense for the quarter was $0.7 million compared to $1.6 million last year, driven by lower borrowings. Average diluted share count for the quarter was $35.7 million versus $35 million for the prior year quarter. With respect to Afghanistan, as we discussed on last quarter's call, we had in-country activity on 2 programs, our WASS program supporting the State Department, and our C130 program supporting four Afghan Airforce aircraft. In conjunction with the state department's exit from Afghanistan, we are winding down related activities and expect that to be completed later this quarter. The C130 program is currently continuing with support of 2 of the 4 aircraft based in the UAE. In total, our FY'21 sales in Afghanistan were $67 million, the margins on these activities were consistent with the overall WASS program, which we have described in the past as being high-single digit operating margin. As John indicated, we generated cash flow from our operating activities from continuing operations of $17.5 million as we continued to reduce our rotables and inventory balances. In addition, we reduced our accounts receivable financing program by $8.4 million in the quarter. Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with net debt of $80.2 million and net leverage of only 0.6 times. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great, thank you, Sean. Looking forward, we expect that demand for our MRO activities will remain strong as airlines continue to focus both on readiness to support the recovery in air travel and on preserving a healthy maintenance supply chain. With respect to part supply, while we saw increasing levels of activity during the quarter, we expect stable performance in the near term as a result of the uncertainty created by the Delta variant. On the government side, the exit from Afghanistan as well as the programs nearing natural completion points will have a near-term impact on our business. However, our Department of Energy contract is an offsetting award that demonstrates the fundamental value proposition of our commercial best practices business model. In addition, we continued to build a solid past performance history. As such, we believe that over time, we remain in an excellent position to grow our government business through additional program wins and expansions of our current positions. Based on these near-term dynamics, we currently expect overall Q2 performance to be similar to Q1. While there remains uncertainty over the timing of the recovery, we are confident that a recovery will occur, and we believe we are exceptionally well positioned. We have emerged from the crisis with an even stronger balance sheet, our government and commercial pipelines are full, and the operating leverage we have created positions us to continue to drive further margin expansion. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Speakers, first question is from the line of Michael Ciarmoli of Truist Securities. Your line is now open.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here and nice results as well. Maybe, John, just the last comments you just made there, 2Q looking similar to 1Q. Are you talking both top and bottom line or is that more just the revenue side you were referencing?
John Holmes:
I think at this point, we're thinking up and down, but I would highlight that again, we remain in an uncertain environment. But when we say similar, we mean top and down.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. And is that, do you think, I mean just trying to get a sense, and maybe I'll feather this in. But I mean, you had really strong, I guess the implied sequential commercial growth in Aviation Services look really strong. I mean was that from some of your additional maybe international customers and maybe, I'm thinking, Air Canada specifically coming online and as some of these other markets open up, does that continue to grow and are we just looking at the top line kind of headwind all stemming from the WASS contract with - specifically?
John Holmes:
Yes. So, it was largely the demand. We had a great quarter in the commercial business across the board. The majority of it was really driven by the trading business, which is still considerably far off pre-pandemic levels, but they did have a nice sequential improvement. What we are seeing is that while we had kind of increasing levels of activity throughout the quarter, we have seen more stability and the pace of that recovery moderate in the last few weeks. And we attribute that to the pullback in the bookings that you've seen from our commercial customers. Your comments on Canada are right on. We're really happy that that Canada has opened up and that our customers there, notably Air Canada are seeing more activity that was not a considerable contributor to this quarter, but we do expect it to contribute to results going forward.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Just on the gross margin, I know you obviously had on the adjusted gross margin good year-over-year growth, but sequentially, it dipped down a bit and you just said, parts was actually strengthening a little bit and recovering a little bit. What else went into the gross margin, sequentially declining given the strong top line. Was it just more MRO, general mix, or anything, any more color you can add there?
Sean Gillen:
Yes, hey, it's Sean. It was a little mix on the government side, that was down a touch sequentially. As we talked on our Q4 call, there’s a few events in Q4 that drove outsized profitability on some government activity. So, you saw a little bit of a decrease on that which is what drove the sequential decrease from 16.5% to 16.1% but still feel very good about the overall profitability. And as we talked about as parts continues to grow that will be accretive to the margin.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Just on the parts and I mean, I'll take a stab here. I'm not sure, if you guys will give much color, but any thoughts or anything, you could provide on how the relationship with Fortress is trending and sort of expectations there?
John Holmes:
Yes, we, the relationship is going very well. That program is performing exactly how we expected. Fortress is a great partner and doing everything they said they were going to do. And that program at this point is a full contributor, I would say that basically at full run rate in the quarter, and we expect those levels to be consistent throughout the rest of the year.
Operator:
Next question is from the line of Ken Herbert of RBC. Your line is now open.
Ken Herbert:
I wanted to first see if I could ask you about retirements. And has your view changed on when we might see or start to see a more meaningful uptick in retirements and subsequently sort of a USM availability or what are you currently seeing in that marketplace?
John Holmes:
We have seen more assets become available to us in the last, in the last few weeks. And there are some. And again, for competitive reasons, I don't want to get into too much detail, but we have seen more things come available that are interesting to us. I would not characterize that as too anecdotal and too soon to call it any sort of trend that would suggest a meaningful uptick in retirement/teardowns. But anecdotally, we have seen a few more come out recently. The activity that we saw this past quarter was largely due to material in stock.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, that's helpful. And as you talk about your MRO business. It sounds like it's seeing some nice uptick. Is that all volume or are you starting to see some better pricing reflected in labor rates in that business?
John Holmes:
The pricing that we've seen has actually been consistent over the last few quarters. We've worked very hard over the last few years to get our customer base down to a more focused long-term, contract-based customer. So, we're operating under long-term contracts in almost all of that business. So, the pricing has been relatively stable. What we have been able to do and this was by design based on the changes that we made during the pandemic has really improved our efficiency inside the hangars and by optimizing our footprint in aligning our hangar space with where we see the most labor availability and that's full time labor availability as opposed to a contract labor, we've been able to achieve superior performance inside the hangars.
Ken Herbert:
Okay that's great. And just bouncing around. I know, you had a program, a contract that you exited in the quarter. Can you just comment on sort of incremental risk you see and what's left of your programs business, and how we should think about any of that risk moving forward?
John Holmes:
Good question. We feel good about the remaining portfolio. That was something that happened right after the end of the 4th quarter and that we characterize that when we announced the end of year results. And so, in terms of anything new happening in this quarter, there wasn't anything but that program contract that was situational. And I would say, kind of a one-off and we feel good about the remaining portfolio and very excited that we extended with Volotea. They've been a long-term customer. That airline is a great success story and the volume of work that we've done with them has grown as they've grown and we're excited to be on that contract for another few years.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Thank you, participants. I'll now turn the call back over to the management for final remarks.
John Holmes:
Listen, we really appreciate everyone's interest and support and I look forward back to being back here in 90 days to talk about our second quarter. Thank you.
Operator:
And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2021 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in the company's news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2021 results. Before I comment on the results, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the last fiscal year. The reduction of commercial passenger air travel to nearly zero shortly before our fiscal year began and the persistently depressed levels of commercial traffic throughout the year tested our industry and our company to agree that was previously hard to imagine. At AAR, we have a strong set of values, one of them is to Every Day, Find a Way. That has never been more important than it has been over the last 16 months, and I'm proud of the results we have delivered. I want to thank our employees for their commitment and endurance and our customers for their continuing to support. And I'm pleased to be able to say that we are now emerging from this crisis an even stronger, more focused company. Turning to our results, sales for the year decreased 20% from $2.07 billion to $1.65 billion and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 39% from $2.15 per share to $1.31 per share. These results reflect the impact of COVID-19 on the demand for commercial air travel, but also our team's ability to reduce costs and increase efficiency to mitigate that impact. As you may recall, our Q4 of last year was only partially impacted by COVID as our hangars completed work on aircraft that were already in the hangar when the pandemic began. As such, I'm particularly pleased to report that sales for the fourth quarter were up 5% from $417 million to $438 million, and I'm even more pleased to report that adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 81% from $0.26 per share to $0.47 per share. Our sales to commercial customers increased 3%, and our sales to government and defense customers increased 7%. Sequentially, our total sales growth was 7% and our adjusted diluted EPS growth was 27%. The EPS growth was driven by our operating margin, which was 5.2% for the quarter on an adjusted basis, up from 3.2% last year and 5% in the third quarter. We saw strong performance in our MRO operations as airlines performed maintenance in advance of the anticipated return to summer leisure travel as well as the strong performance in our government programs' contracts. Notably, we have not seen much of a recovery in our commercial parts supply businesses as operators continue to consume their existing inventory. Parts supply is one of our higher margin activities and the performance in the quarter did not yet reflect the recovery of that business. Turning to cash, it was another strong quarter, as we generated $23.5 million from operating activities from continuing operations. We also continue to reduce the usage of our accounts receivable financing program. Excluding the impact of that AR program, our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $33.3 million. The results for the year reflect our accomplishments in three key areas. First, we moved quickly at the outset of the pandemic to reduce costs and optimize our portfolio for efficiency. We did this by consolidating multiple facilities, making permanent reductions to our fixed and variable costs, exiting or restructuring several underperforming commercial programs' contracts and completing the divestiture of our Composites business, which had been unprofitable in recent quarters. Second, we continued to win important new business. In particular, we created a partnership with Fortress to supply used serviceable material on the CFM56-5B and -7B engine types. We were awarded a follow-on contract from the Navy that extended and expanded our support of its C-40 fleet. We expanded our distribution relationship with GE subsidiary Unison. We entered into a 10-year agreement with Honeywell to be an exclusive repair provider for certain 737 MAX components. And most recently, we signed a multi-year agreement with United to provide 737 heavy maintenance in our Rockford facility. Finally, we focused on our balance sheet and working capital management, which allowed us to generate over $100 million of cash from operating activities from continuing operations, notwithstanding the investments that we made to support new business growth. We demonstrated that we can generate cash even in a down-market. And as a result, we are now well under one times levered and exceptionally well positioned to fund our growth going forward. There are very few companies in commercial aviation that are emerging from the pandemic with a debt level that is actually lower than when they entered. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Sean Gillen to discuss the results in more detail.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $437.6 million were up 5% or $21.1 million year-over-year. Sales in our Aviation Services segment were up 6.5%, driven by continued strong performance in government, as well as the recovery in commercial. Sales in our Expeditionary Services segment were down slightly, reflecting the divestiture of our Composites business. Gross profit margin in the quarter was 16.4% versus 8.7% in the prior year quarter. And adjusted gross profit margin was 16.5% versus 13.6% in the prior year quarter. Aviation Services gross profit increased $32.9 million, and Expeditionary Services gross profit increased $2.5 million. Gross profit margin in our commercial activities was 13.4%. This reflects the relative strength in MRO where we've been able to drive margin improvement through the efficiency actions we have taken. As the commercial market continues to recover, we would expect higher overall commercial gross margins. Gross profit margin in our government activities was 19.7%, which was driven by continued strong performance as well as certain events that occurred during the quarter. The adjustments in the quarter include $2.1 million related to the closure of our Goldsboro facility, which had supported our Mobility business within Expeditionary Services. We have completed our consolidation of those operations into Mobility's Cadillac, Michigan facility, and the adjustment reflects our current estimate of sale proceeds from the building. Looking forward, subsequent to the end of Q4, one of our commercial programs' contracts was terminated. As a result, we expect to recognize impairment charge of between $5 million and $10 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22. This contract had been underperforming for us in recent quarters. And with this termination, our restructuring actions in commercial programs are largely complete. As John described, we have taken steps over the last year to rationalize certain underperforming operations, including the divestiture of our Composites business, the closure of our Duluth heavy maintenance facility and the exit or restructuring of certain contracts. These activities, along with the terminated contracts I just described, collectively contributed approximately $140 million of annualized pre-COVID sales, which will not return as commercial markets recover. However, the absence of these operations is now part of what's driving our increasing profitability. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $48.8 million. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $46.7 million, up only $0.2 million from the prior year quarter despite the increase in sales. As a reminder, SG&A in the prior year quarter already reflected our cost reduction actions. For fiscal year '22, we would expect a modest increase in SG&A compared to FY '21 as we invest in certain initiatives such as digital that will drive improved performance in future years. We continue to focus on driving SG&A as a percent of sales to 10% or lower as our top line recovers. As John indicated, we generated cash flow from our operating activities from continuing operations of $23.5 million as we continued to reduce our inventory balance. In addition, we reduced our accounts receivable financing program by $9.8 million in the quarter from $48.4 million to $38.6 million. As a result, our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with net debt of $83.4 million versus $197.3 million at the end of last year. And our net leverage as of year-end was only 0.7 times. Thank you for your attention, and I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. Looking forward, we are optimistic that the significant recent increase in US domestic leisure flying is both enduring and a leading indicator of return to business in international travel. We've seen a nice recovery in heavy maintenance and expect that performance to continue. On that note, while we are aware of the tight labor market, we believe that the labor-related programs that we have established to recruit, train and retain skilled technicians will continue to serve us well, particularly when those programs are coupled with our ongoing investment in innovation to drive efficiency and differentiation inside of our hangars. Also, although the commercial parts supply business has lagged behind the recovery, we have recently seen some early and modest signs of a rebound in that market as well, both in our USM and new parts activities. On the government side, which has been very strong for us, we do expect a moderation in the pace of growth as buying under previous administration normalizes and some of our programs come to a natural completion, such as the C-40 aircraft procurement program for the Marine Corps, but the valuable past performance that we have continued to build and the cost reduction actions that we've taken put us in a strong position to continue to take market share, and our government pipeline remains strong. The path and pace of the commercial air travel recovery continue to remain uncertain, which is underscored by the emergence of the delta variants. As such, we are not issuing full-year guidance. However, in the immediate term, we expect to see performance in Q1 that is similar to or modestly better than Q4. As you know, Q1 is typically our slowest quarter, whereas Q4 is typically our strongest quarter. So normally, you would see a decline from Q4 to Q1. However, this year's expectation of similar performance reflects our belief that our commercial markets will continue their recovery. Over the medium and longer term, we are exceptionally well positioned, we are stronger today than where we were when we entered the pandemic, and we are excited to leverage our efficiency gains, optimize portfolio and strong balance sheet to continue to drive growth and margin expansion going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
Hi, good afternoon, John and Sean.
John Holmes:
Hey, Rob.
Robert Spingarn:
Hey, there. I wanted to see if we could expand a little on a couple of things you just talked about. First, just looking back at Q4 and perhaps talking separately about MRO and parts, how that trended throughout the quarter and then, into the first quarter?
John Holmes:
Sure. MRO was relatively stable throughout the quarter and that continues to be the case as we go into the first quarter, which and I think we commented on this in the last earnings call. That's a bit unusual. I usually see a decline of activity in MRO as aircraft return to the sky for summer flying. In this case, we are seeing a more steady performance there. The parts businesses did continue to improve slightly throughout Q4, and we have seen a bit of improvement most notably on the parts' trading side just at the beginning of the current quarter.
Robert Spingarn:
And John, is there anything obscure in the numbers where we're maybe seeing strength from cargo, maybe obscuring some deeper weakness in passenger?
John Holmes:
No, the cargo business has been again relatively stable throughout the entire pandemic. I mean, we saw a bit of growth early on as we turned our attention to that market. But I'd say for the last several quarters now, it's been relatively stable. I think what you're seeing is obviously air travel is pacing ahead here in the US. And so, you're seeing some of our larger customer’s burn through inventory that they had on the shelf as opposed to buying from suppliers. We expect that to come to an end and expect to see more activity in the used parts and new parts business in the coming quarters as they burn through that inventory. But in the rest of the world and our parts business is our most international activity. You've got markets with one exception, China, I'll come back to that in a second. You've got markets that are just behind in terms of overall flying activity. And that's certainly impacting the pace of the recovery in the parts business as well. But China on the other hand, as you know, their domestic flying has been -- has recovered largely and has been that way for several months. And we actually had a record year in the China market.
Robert Spingarn:
You sort of segued pretty well into what I wanted to ask you next, which is to look beyond the near term and think about the recovery with regard to the different pieces of Aviation Services, so largely overhaul and then, parts. When you think about the recovery to pre-COVID levels, what are the -- how do you frame it when you look at MRO and then, separately at parts? What needs to happen for you to get to an Aviation Services number in the mid-500s, $500 million; you know what I'm saying?
John Holmes:
Yeah sure. Exactly. So in the MRO business, we're being much more disciplined about the work that we take on post-pandemic than what we had before. We're really matching the volume of work that we choose to accept, if you will, with the availability of skilled labor and pre-pandemic, we had a very heavy reliance on contract labor to produce more labor hours, but that was in a much less profitable level than what we're able to achieve today. So, based on the current footprint and labor capacity, it's possible that we'll be a bit smaller in the heavy maintenance business, but a much more profitable business than we were pre-pandemic. Having said that, we continue to look at our footprint in North America and look at ways to potentially better align that footprint with labor availability than based on where we see the most supply of labor than what we have today. So that's something we're continuing to monitor. On the parts' side of the business, in the USM market, we see the potential for that to actually even exceed pre-COVID levels based on early indications that we've talked about this in prior quarters based on indications from the customer base that there would likely be an increased acceptance of used material in the aftermarket. Obviously, we need to make sure we have material to supply, but we see the potential for even greater growth out of that business over the next couple of years. And then, on the new parts business, we remain very, very bullish on that business. We've announced a number of new distribution agreements over the last couple of years. There are more in the pipeline that we plan to announce, and that business as we add more parts, both on the government side, as well as the commercial side, we definitely see that business growing beyond pandemic levels. And finally on commercial programs, that's a business that we've done a lot of work to restructure. It's in a much better place than it was pre-pandemic. It is smaller than it was pre-pandemic, but we still intend to be a participant at that market, but just more disciplined about the contract that we go after.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then just to finish this up, is there a way to gauge your utilization in MRO in terms of your hangar capacity? Where are you relative to the capacity that you have? That's part one of the question. Part two of the question is, we've heard anecdotally that some capacity globally has gone away during COVID, and there could be a shortage of heavy maintenance capacity. So those are the two questions. Your current utilization and whether there is a shortage and does that help you from a market share perspective at some point?
John Holmes:
Sure. In terms of capacity measured as looking at our footprint, we still have a lot of capacity left, but again, we're really measuring capacity on our ability to attract full-time skilled labor. We are using contract labor a bit, but we don't want to rely on that is heavily as we did pre-COVID. So based on the labor capacity where we're pretty close to full at this point. And having said that, as I mentioned, we're looking at potential opportunities to realign our footprint, but we're with where we see available labor, which would expand our capacity down the road. And then, in terms of a shortage overall, there is definitely an elevated amount of maintenance activity out there right now. There's a lot of deferred maintenance that has not been done. There is -- and I think that's globally and you're certainly seeing that here in North America and I think you'll see that elsewhere as -- if aircraft come back to the skies. So I agree with the comment that there is a shortage. I think a lot of that's driven by return to service work, which obviously is a moment in time, but we -- our goal is just to remain very disciplined, as I mentioned in the beginning, about the work that we take on because we want to hold on to these production efficiency gains that we've achieved in the last couple of quarters.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Thanks for the help, John.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Rob.
Operator:
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Pete Osterland:
Hey, good afternoon. This is Pete Osterland down for Mike. First, just wanted to get a little more color on your near-term margin outlook. Is there any incremental operational efficiency that you're still planning to implement that could help give you even more margin leverage? And on the other hand, are there any specific pressure points you're experiencing in terms of cost inflation as you start fiscal '22?
John Holmes:
So, we've done a lot as we've mentioned in terms of structural changes to improve the margin. Those are largely done. And Sean mentioned this most recent contract that was terminated that will contribute to that. So a lot of that has been done. The majority of the margin improvement that we expect to see in the medium term will come as the revenue recovers in our more profitable parts activities. So I would say the lion's share will come from that over the longer term. I should say medium to longer term, we would expect to see additional margin improvement coming from certain of our digital initiatives. We are making investments in that area that will start to come through in the coming quarters in terms of you'll see investments that we made. But long term that should add efficiency particularly inside our hangar operations.
Pete Osterland:
Okay. Thanks. And then just wanted to ask on your Expeditionary business, just given the relatively small size of the business and the lower margins versus the company average, would you be open to considering strategic alternatives for that business?
John Holmes:
It's not something we typically discuss publicly, but we articulated several years ago, our strategy is to be an aviation services company. And as we look at the portfolio, anything that doesn't necessarily align with that strategy long term, certainly, we continue to evaluate.
Pete Osterland:
Okay. Thank you very much.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Joseph DeNardi:
Thanks. Good afternoon. John or Sean, can you give us what commercial margins. I guess, adjusted commercial margins were in the quarter?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. We don't break out the margins on an adjusted basis, but you can kind of take a look at the adjustments and kind of allocate some of that, but it's relatively close to the margin that I gave in terms of GAAP.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. Okay. And then John, just on the parts' side of the business, can you talk about whether you're seeing any difference there kind of geographically? Are US airlines kind of behaving differently from an inventory management standpoint? And how much longer do you foresee kind of inventories being able to be burned down before they have to come back to the market?
John Holmes:
Yeah. Definitely, the US airlines -- outside of China, the US airlines are certainly well ahead in terms of that inventory burn down. And as I mentioned just in recent weeks, we started to see some noticeable pickup in activity on the parts businesses, both new and USM and that's largely being driven by US carriers. We expect that you'd see the same kind of curve occur around the world as aircraft get back into service. I mentioned a couple of calls ago that we do a lot of business up in Canada. We've got two great facilities up there. And Canada has been largely shut down through this time. And we were very encouraged yesterday to see the announcement come out that they've got a timeline to open the borders. And Air Canada, for example, subsequently followed with an announcement that they're going to be putting more flights in the network as a result. So you will see that kind of thing we expect as the vaccines are deployed around the world, and those airlines will go through the same. I'm assuming the same type of curve where they will burn through what they have on the shelf and they will return to purchasing from us.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. Okay. That's great. And then, on Fortress, John, you mentioned I think that, that is starting to contribute. Could you characterize whether the contribution is at full run rate yet, or how much that has left to go until it's fully up and running?
John Holmes:
Yeah. That's actually going, the program is going really well. Fortress is a great partner. So far, they are right on the money with the number of engines that are coming through to us. The -- so, I would say the induction of engines is right on pace. The bookings that we are starting to see now that the engines are being processed and parts are being repaired and they are being marketed to customers, so the bookings are right on pace with our expectations, but you did not see very significant shipments yet in this quarter or in Q4. You will see a bit more in Q1. And we'd expect later this fiscal year in terms of actual shipments in the quarter, we would be at full run rate.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. That's great. And then just lastly, Sean, the $140 million that you referenced, does that capture the C-40 and the commercial programs headwind? Is what that was?
Sean Gillen:
No. So that's just taken a look at the, call it, activities, will be exited like closing Duluth or selling the Composites business and then, contracts that we've restructured or exited. The revenue that those contributed pre-COVID was $140 million. So it's not kind of a forward-looking for C-40 or anything like that, just quantifying the sales of activities that we have exited over the last several quarters.
Joseph DeNardi:
Got it. Okay. Could you characterize what you expect from the defense business for the year, if the commercial side is little bit too hard to call? Do you have more visibility on the defense side?
Sean Gillen:
Yeah. We're not -- obviously defense got a little bit better the line of sight, but in terms of not giving guidance, don't want to kind of go into specifics. As John mentioned, some of these contracts may be recompete and ultimately, stay or add. So there's some uncertainty there and going to quantify kind of the forward look for sales on that.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. Thank you.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Herbert:
Yeah. Hey, John and Sean, good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hi, Ken.
Kenneth Herbert:
Hey, John. As you look then into fiscal '22, when you think about your parts business, is there any reason you would see demand lower than aircraft utilization? And I'm guessing as utilization continues to increase, perhaps USM represents scenario where you could see faster growth, but just to finer point just to put a finer point on it, how are you viewing the pull on the parts side relative to utilization on the aircraft side as we head into fiscal '22?
John Holmes:
I mean, we -- I think you're, you have pent-up demand, there is no question out there. And so, we would expect to see once that inventory is burned down, thanks to elevated utilization that our recovery would, I would say, kind of outpace utilization in the early part as you catch up, if you will, but then track with increased utilization once we hit steady state in terms of parts supply and consumption.
Kenneth Herbert:
And do you think that catch-up is a quarter or two or could it be even longer?
John Holmes:
We -- I think what I would say is that the US is definitely going to be sooner than international because of the increase in utilization that you're seeing in the US. It's difficult to predict right now. I'll go back to what I said earlier and as much as just in the last few weeks, we've seen some higher highs, if you will, in the -- that parts activity. So we're encouraged, but at this point, I wouldn't want to attempt to predict precisely when we would see that elevation.
Kenneth Herbert:
Yeah. Okay. And as we look at the MRO business, have you started to see yet the industry pull any widebody heavy work back to United States that previously or currently is done in Asia and China in particular? And if we do start to see that trend, is that an interesting market to you, or you would maybe look to capture some of that and add capacity to capture some of that, or how do you think about that?
John Holmes:
So, at the top of my head, I can't take the specific examples yet, but anecdotally, absolutely there is a lot of discussion about that. We have had conversations with a couple of our customers and as much as to the extent that, that occurs, would we be able to service it. And it kind of all depends in terms of how we balance that versus other demand. And historically, I think that we've been largely a narrow-body operation in North America, both in Canada and the US and so, that's been our primary focus. But to the extent that an existing customer wants to repatriate work and we can make room for it and find the technical labor to support it, would certainly be open.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. And pre-COVID, you had talked about perhaps pursuing PMA on the parts side as a growth opportunity, is that still something you're looking at or how do you view that, that opportunity now?
John Holmes:
Yeah. We continue to believe that should be a part of our portfolio, and we continue to look at internal initiatives as well as partnership opportunities with other PMA houses out there.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. Great. And just finally, on the government side, we're hearing about some pressure from the DLA. I know you've got a number of contracts on the distribution side for military or government parts. Are you seeing any of that pressure yet on the DLA, or how does that look from fiscal '21 to '22 in terms of their purchasing?
John Holmes:
Yeah. Good question, and we are. We've definitely seen a moderation in the weekly order volume out of the DLA. And we attribute that to the new administration is going to focus on spending money on the next-generation platforms as opposed to the prior administration's focus on sustainment and readiness. So we do expect moderated growth in that regard. Having said that, even though same-store sales on military product lines may actually come at or a little bit of pressure, we've got a number of new distribution agreements that we've signed or have in the queue that ultimately we believe would still provide growth over time in that market as we sign up new distributorships.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. Great. Thanks a lot and really nice job managing the business through the downturn.
John Holmes:
Thank you, Ken. Really appreciate that.
Operator:
Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Josh Sullivan:
Hey, good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hey, Josh. How are you?
Josh Sullivan:
I'm doing well. Can you just kind of outline some of your Afghanistan exposure? Is it an opportunity as they pull out on some of your support services, or is it more of a headwind at this point?
John Holmes:
It's a great question. There is one program -- we have a couple different operations that are involved in Afghanistan. One program is actually being restructured. The operation will change, but the kind of financial impact to AAR will be neutral to positive based on that restructuring. The other significant operation we have over there is to support the WASS contract. And at this point, it's unclear what, if any, impact the withdrawal will have to that operation. We do -- but your point on the opportunity is exactly correct. I mean, there will be a number of ways that, that country will be supported differently going forward, and we are focused on participating in that to the extent that we can.
Josh Sullivan:
And then, just on the WASS contract, I mean globally outside of Afghanistan, are there growing opportunities or is it really in Afghanistan kind of opportunity for you?
John Holmes:
So WASS, I would say, philosophically, a democratic administration tend to rely more on diplomacy than a republican administration. So WASS has had its best years under Obama, for example, prior to Trump. And so, we believe that to the extent that the current administration look to increase the level of diplomatic activity around the world that WASS could be a beneficiary of that. None of that has occurred yet, but certainly, it's something it's on our mind.
Josh Sullivan:
Got it. And then, just following up on the PMA question, do you see yourselves more as a distributor of the PMA, or do you think you will be investing in engineering resources and pursuing PMA of your own -- your making?
John Holmes:
Both.
Josh Sullivan:
Got it. Both, right. Thank you for the time.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn:
Hi, I'm back just with a couple more questions.
John Holmes:
Hey, great.
Robert Spingarn:
In MRO, what does smaller but more profitable look like in the future? Maybe one way to think about this is pre-COVID, we thought of it is about a third of Aviation Services.
John Holmes:
Yeah. I wouldn't want to quantify that at this point. We -- that's not something that we historically broken out, but we tend to think of it in terms of labor our production and for competitive reasons wouldn't necessarily want to get into that, but we would expect fewer hours but a higher yield on those hours this fiscal year. And then, I would also point to -- that's where we are today. But to the extent that we can stay true to the model of servicing the demand with full-time employees as opposed to relying on contractors and adjust our footprint, so that we can continue to attract more full-time employees and go where the skilled labor is, that would allow us to expand our capacity and potentially get back to the hour production that we saw pre-COVID, but again on a -- with much better yield. So that's how we're thinking about it.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then, these -- all these questions are in a similar way in looking to the future. You've announced a lot of different deals, joint ventures and relationships with customers during COVID. When we think about all of that business, how do we size that relative to, I guess, Aviation Services before? In other words, how do we think about the new business in terms of how additive it is?
Sean Gillen:
I think a lot of those -- and that goes back to my earlier comments around the parts businesses in particular. We believe that USM, thanks to likely increased user adoption of aftermarket material as well as programs like Fortress and then on the new parts distribution business, our -- the lines that we've announced over the last year and a half as those grow back to pre-COVID levels. We see both of those businesses have the opportunity and the foundation to ultimately exceed the volume that we saw pre-COVID just on deals that we've already done. That's not counting on new business that we have in the pipeline. At this point, again, I would say it's just difficult to sketch out the pace and size of that, but we have a broader foundation to build from than we did pre-COVID for those businesses in particular.
Robert Spingarn:
And is there anything we should take from the Fortress or other deals about your activity on the engine side as in contrast to the airframes? We think about MRO, we think about airframe, but clearly you're doing engine work. What's the trend there engine versus airframe in terms of parts?
John Holmes:
Yeah. So the airframe has always been the focus of -- the primary focus of the MRO businesses. And don't forget you've got landing gear components in there as well, but airframe maintenance business is the primary focus of the MRO business. The parts business, the primary focus in the aftermarket has historically been the engines, and we expect that to continue and we see the most opportunity for us there, supplying engine parts, not overhauling engines, but supplying engine parts in most cases to shops that performed the overhauls. And again, as Fortress is detailed, there is a tremendous amount of cost savings opportunity for customers as they want to overhaul engines by using aftermarket engine part materials as opposed to buying new from the OEMs.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then just on distribution, these distribution deals that we've seen some investment in in the past. What are you expecting going forward there? Does any structural change to the desire to do that more opportunity post-COVID to put your balance sheet to work?
John Holmes:
Absolutely. We see a lot of opportunity for organic investment in that market. You recall a year ago, we announced the Unison deal. That was a meaningful investment. That's tracking right where we expected. There are other programs that we've announced since then and other things that are in the pipeline. Some of them require capital; some of them do not. But we are very excited about the position we occupy in the distribution space because unlike a couple of our larger competitors, at this point we've got a balance sheet that we can put to work and it's our core focus.
Robert Spingarn:
Right. And my last one also on investment and maybe, Sean, you have this is, what do you expect or how much do you expect to invest in digitization in fiscal '22?
Sean Gillen:
Yeah. I think there will be some modest investment. Some of that will be in SG&A, as I mentioned, to see a bit of an increase there. And then in terms of the capital, capex, obviously last year was a lean year for capex, so you will see some of that digital investment come through capex, which will be higher than this past year, a little bit more in line with historical years before that in terms of total capex.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Thank you both.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Rob.
Operator:
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Herbert:
Yeah, hi. Thanks. Sean, I just wanted to follow up on that. You generated really strong cash in fiscal '21. It sounds like capex heads up in '22. Can you walk through a couple of sort of the key moving pieces as we think about free cash flow in '22? And maybe if you're comfortable, how we should start to think about sort of a framework around cash conversion or where you think the business should be on more normal basis?
Sean Gillen:
Yeah. I think we've made a lot of improvements in terms of the cost of the company, which shows up in our cash flow efficiency and working capital management. As you think about what occurred in FY '21 and try to -- and compare it to FY '22, obviously inventory was a significant provider of cash in the fiscal year as we focused on that and managed our position there. I don't think you will see the same performance in FY '21 because, as John mentioned, there will be opportunities both on new material as well as used material, which will show up in inventory largely to put capital to work, but we're going to have and sketched out a specific conversion target. We will continue to focus on managing working capital and driving free cash flow, but with a little bit more of an eye toward putting money to work on new investments.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Ken.

March 23, 2021
Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2021 Third Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As noted in the Company's news release and the Risk Factors section of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31st, 2020. In providing the forward-looking statements, the Company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2021 results. I would like to begin the call by once again recognizing our employees. Their unwavering commitment, professionalism and flexibility have allowed us to continue to support our customers without interruption over the past year. I'm grateful for their loyalty and sacrifices and thank them all for what they have done and continue to do for AAR. Turning to the quarter. Our sales decreased 26% year-over-year from $553 million to $410 million and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 45% from $0.67 per share to $0.37 per share. Our sales to commercial customers decreased 42% and our sales to government and defense customers increased 4%. For the quarter sales and government to government and defense customers were 49% of our total sales. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, we expected relatively stable revenue, which is what we saw in this quarter with sales up 2% sequentially. In MRO, we did see a sequential increase in hangar activity due to increased demand supporting anticipated leisure travel. In our commercial parts activities, revenue was relatively stable, but we were encouraged to see orders across a broader range of customers during the quarter than what we saw in Q2. Our government businesses, which have performed very well over the past year continued their strong performance delivering another quarter of year-over-year growth. Regarding profitability, our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 19% sequentially reflecting our continued margin improvement progress. On an adjusted basis which excludes the benefit of the CARES Act, our gross margin improved sequentially from 13.9% to 16.1% and our operating margin improved from 4% to 5%. We have now more than doubled our adjusted operating margin over the past two quarters while operating in a stable revenue environment. We are also proud to a fully reinstated salaries and 401(k) benefits at the beginning of the third quarter, which had been a priority for us as we look to attract and retain top talent. Even with the compensation restoration, we were able to still deliver a full point of adjusted operating margin improvement. That improvement reflects the operating leverage that we have created through cost reductions, efficiency gains and portfolio reshaping over the last year. Turning to cash. Once again, we were cash flow positive in the quarter even while making investments in new business wins. We generated $18 million from operating activities from continuing operations and remain in a strong balance sheet position with 1.1 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Speaking of new business, we also continue to secure and execute new wins during the quarter. We expanded our distribution relationship with GE subsidiary Unison on a five-year program from the U.S. Air Force to provide and repair an overhaul of S-16 accessories and extended our support of the Navy's H-60 Seahawk platform for an additional seven years. We also began operations on our previously announced Honeywell 737 MAX EBAS contract. With that I'll turn it over to our CFO, Sean Gillen to review this quarter's results in more detail.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $410.3 million were down 25.8% or $142.8 million year-over-year driven by the reduction in commercial passenger flying activity due to COVID-19. Sequentially sales were up 1.7% with commercial sales up 7% driven by MRO volumes and government and defense sales down 3.3% driven by the scheduled reduction in activity and our program to deliver two C-40 aircraft for the U.S. Marine Corps. Gross profit margin in the quarter increased to 21% from 11.8% in the prior year quarter driven primarily by the CARES Act payroll support. On an adjusted basis excluding the CARES Act support and other items, gross profit margin was 16.1% consistent with the 16% in the year ago quarter despite the significant decline in sales. Sequentially adjusted gross profit was up meaningfully from 13.9% to 16.1% reflecting the actions we have taken to reduce our indirect costs and drive efficiencies. Regarding expeditionary services specifically, gross profit margin increased to 17% from 0.4% in the prior year quarter driven by the divestiture of the composites business and improved performance at the mobility operation. SG&A expenses were $44.9 million for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $42.8 million or 10.4% of sales down $9 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting the reduction of our overhead cost structure. With respect to our accounting for the CARES Act payroll support, we fully recognize our deferred credit in Q3 and we will no longer have income associated with the CARES Act support. We have an $8.8 million promissory note associated with the CARES Act, which we expect to repay during the fourth quarter. Also, we continue to have certain foreign subsidiaries that are eligible for stimulus provided by foreign governments. Consistent with prior quarters, government subsidies including the CARES Act are reflected in our GAAP income primarily as a reduction in our cost of sales. However, we exclude these benefits from our adjusted results. Other adjustments during the quarter included $4 million of loss provision and exit costs for commercial programs contracts, $1.5 million of which reduced sales. In addition, there was a gain of $4.3 million related to a legal settlement, which we have excluded from our adjusted results. Also during the quarter, we reached a tentative agreement with the Department of Justice to settle the investigation of airlift under the False Claims Act for approximately 11.5 million. As such, we recognized a charge in the quarter of $4.2 million and discontinued operations. As a reminder, we completed the exit of our airlift business in the fourth quarter of last year. In the quarter, we generated $17.6 million of cash in our operating activities from continuing operations. We reduced inventories by $21 million from our second quarter as we continue to focus on working capital management. Our net debt at quarter end was $108.4 million down from $112.1 million at the end of Q2 and from a $171.1 million at the end of Q3 of last year. In addition, our accounts receivable financing program has decreased by $37.2 million over the last year from $85.6 million at the end of the year ago quarter to $48.4 million. Our overall leverage and liquidity remains strong with net debt of 1.1 times adjusted EBITDA, unrestricted cash of $99.2 million and unused capacity under our revolver of over $400 million. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. Overall, we are encouraged by the widely reported recent increases in demand for domestic leisure travel and we remain optimistic about the broader commercial market recovery. We expect modest sequential improvement in Q4 and continued improvement thereafter as the vaccine is distributed and current travel restrictions which are impacting some of our larger international customers are lifted. As that occurs and our revenue recovers, we remain committed to leveraging our current cost structure to drive continued margin improvement. In addition our balance sheet puts us in a very strong position to be able to fund growth. We expect to make investments in our USM and distribution activities as well as to continue to invest in our technology and digital initiatives. These actions along with the continued strength of our government business and the early signs of a recovery and our commercial market give us increasing confidence that we will emerge from the pandemic as an even stronger and more profitable company. With that I'd like to turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
Nice quarter from you guys. And John I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the trends here maybe just sequentially. I know you don't like to break out the businesses too much, but if we think about the sequential performance from Q2 to Q3 in terms of the commercial business parts versus MRO. I think you said - was it a 2% growth overall in commercial between the two quarters?
John Holmes:
That is 7% sequential.
Robert Spingarn:
I'm sorry, 7%. How do we think about that in those two different businesses? What's stronger?
John Holmes:
Yes, sure. So we did see elevated. In MRO, we saw elevated maintenance activity going from Q2 to Q3. And in the parts business it was relatively stable, typically you do see maintenance activity pace ahead of parts requirement because repairing aircraft generates parts requirement. So that's not surprising us necessarily, but the growth primarily came from the MRO segment. In the part side though, as I mentioned, we are encouraged that we saw a broader customer base returning to the market on the part side both in new parts sales and USM part sales. If we look at the prior couple of quarters, there was quite a bit of activity being driven out of the freighter and cargo market and we thought the name candidly that we hadn't seen in a while from the passenger market come back in the quarter. All of that still added up to relatively stable performance, but it was encouraging to see some of those customers come back.
Robert Spingarn:
Yes, on the USM, I mean, what else can we say about part out activity based on what you've seen and trends there?
John Holmes:
Yes, so and that would kind of varies by asset type. So if we look at the freighter market, the engines and airframe that support the freighter market, we got very strong demand and the supply at this point because of all the conversions going on is actually relatively tight. If we look at the broader narrow-body market, the current generation A320s, current generation 737NG, we are seeing increasing interest from customers that previously not had an interest in USM as well as I mentioned customers that we haven't heard from a little while come back into the game. So we expect increases in USM demand there, but we do differently than what we see in the freight and cargo market. We see more supply becoming available in the broader narrow-body market.
Robert Spingarn:
Yes, I was going to ask you, how is the supply on the passenger side, is it there or airlines or owners making decisions to part out some of these NGs or maybe COs or I imagine older aircraft as well. They are sitting there in the desert?
John Holmes:
Yes, I think, so yes, I think, overall that activity - the kind of the line from grounding to retirement from part out has taken a bit longer to occur, that we might have thought a couple of quarters ago, but we still believe you're going to see increased material availability over time. Our focus certainly as we want to pay attention to those macro trends, but our focus is on our own agreements to give us proprietary access to material to support the demand that we see ourselves and the Fortress deal that we announced last quarter is an example of that.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And just one more on this, if you look at the fleet of aircraft that you cater to in your commercial business. Is there any way to estimate what percentage of those are flying domestically here in the United States versus those that fly international routes?
John Holmes:
We'd have to look at that.
Robert Spingarn:
And then, Sean, just on the margins. I wanted to ask you if you could just delve into some of the improvement, it sounds like it's overhead driven, you've taken out a fair amount of overhead. How much of that reduction is going to be sustainable through the recovery?
Sean Gillen:
Yes, we would anticipate that the vast majority of overhead takeout is sustainable through the recovery and kind of committed to that reduced overhead cost structure. We are seeing some efficiency improvement in our operations, but then there's also the reduced indirect and that shows up in the gross profit. And then the reduction in SG&A, you can see in the quarter as well. So some of that will come back as volumes recover, but we do think that the vast majority will stick.
Robert Spingarn:
So you should be able to hit higher margins than before at some point when we get well into this recovery volumes are there?
Operator:
Our next question comes from Ken Herbert of Canaccord. Your line is open.
Ken Herbert:
I just wanted to start out put you on the spot a little bit. Our fourth quarter revenues going to be up for you, I mean you're going to anniversary, obviously, the significant drop you saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. So how should we think about the sequential movement into the fourth quarter and do we see positive revenue growth for the first time?
John Holmes:
As we mentioned, we expect a modest improvement sequentially from Q4 to - from Q3 to Q4 and not ready to necessarily call year-over-year improvement, but it's pretty close.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, that's helpful. And just to follow up on the MRO discussion. Are you - with - it sounds like you're seeing an uptick in backlog. How would you - how would you think about sort of where you are at your hangers now in terms of utilization or maybe lines that are booked here through the fourth quarter. I mean how do we think about any excess capacity you may have or how is that trending?
John Holmes:
Yes, so overall we're encouraged by the levels of demand that we're seeing for hangar space right now. One thing that we mentioned before that we do have some international activity that is pacing behind what we're seeing in the U.S. and as you know we have a couple of fairly meaningful operations up in Canada and Canada has been closed like what you're seeing over in Europe. So those operations still have a ways to go to get back to pre-COVID level, but in the U.S., we're definitely seeing a recovery pacing ahead. We are, as John indicated, very focused on our operating efficiency. And what we've driven over the last several quarters is a much more efficient and productive and higher quality operation in our MRO facilities than what we saw before COVID. And so we're being very thoughtful and very disciplined about how we bring back work across the network. So that we preserve the gains that we've made in the past few quarters. One of the point on MRO - you have a mix of work that is being done right now to prepare for what we expect will be a busy summer travel season, the leisure travel season, but you've also got some deferred maintenance that starting to come through. And as we think about Q4 going into Q1, it's likely that you wouldn't see the typical seasonal decline in the hangars that you have historically because airlines at least in the U.S. are going to use that time most likely to catch up on some deferred maintenance.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, that's helpful. Is the demand such the John you were able to see any relief in labor rates or how do we think about pressure there and the supply demand balance?
John Holmes:
So far it's been relatively consistent throughout the entire pandemic.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is open.
Joseph DeNardi:
Sean, just a quick one for you. You mentioned adjusted gross margins were 16.1%. Can you give us that on kind of commercial versus defense like is commercial a little bit below that and defense is a little bit above that. Is that the right way to think about it?
Sean Gillen:
That's right. Commercial is a little bit below. Defense is a little bit above. You'll see some of that detail in the Q that will be filed here shortly.
Joseph DeNardi:
And then, John, you spoke about this a little bit, but can you just talk about kind of your exposure domestic versus international on the commercial side. As you mentioned, it seems like U.S. airlines are kind of getting capacity back to pre-COVID levels a little faster than international like where are you on U.S. commercial relative to pre-COVID and where are you on international commercial relative to pre-COVID at this point?
John Holmes:
Sure. Historically, the business mix has been relatively 65% domestic and 35% international. As it relates to the domestic, we still have a ways to go to get back to where we were relative to pre-COVID levels and that's across both MRO and the parts business in particular. The International segment, as you mentioned, is pacing far behind due to the restrictions that are in place. China, China domestic is almost back to pre-COVID levels, but the Rest of Asia is very, very soft and Europe remains very, very soft relative to pre-COVID levels.
Joseph DeNardi:
And then just on the Fortress deal, it's clear that kind of you all view that as pretty important. I suspect some investors are struggling to quantify that opportunity exactly. So can you just kind of give your best shot of that like if you had the agreement in place pre-COVID, what would that have meant for the business like how much would that helped maybe? Thanks.
John Holmes:
Yes. I appreciate you asking that. I don't want to get into specifically quantifying that deal, but suffice to say, it would have been a meaningful contributor to us, and we expect it to be a meaningful contributor to the trading results for the USM result. Fortress has been a great partner for many years supporting that joint venture with them was really a nice next step in the relationship and we are - we have received the first set of material from them. So it will be a, I would say, a small contributor this quarter and we expect growth going into next fiscal year.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli from Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Thanks for taking my question and nice results here. Maybe just back to the I think what Rob was asking on the margins. I mean the adjusted gross margin 16.1% really a strong number there and it sounds like you're not getting any benefit from lower labor rates. Can you just maybe give us a sense, I mean, John if we look back a year ago, you were doing $100 million more plus in revenue and the gross margins were pressured obviously there were some labor challenge, but structurally you talked about more efficiencies. I mean what specifically is driving that and I mean if I look at it now I mean it sounds like you've got a little bit of a mix headwind with stronger MRO. So presumably one some of that parts volume kicks in, it seems like you shed more runway here with parts, with volumes maybe more efficiencies with the market getting in line, but can you give us maybe dig a little bit deeper and tell us exactly how you're putting up these margins with the topline pressures?
John Holmes:
Sure. Absolutely, and again we're very, very pleased with the progress that we made in a short amount of time. And as you know we've been taking a number of actions across the company and in a number of different areas to drive this margin improvement that includes exiting underperforming product lines, underperforming contract. We consolidated a number of facilities and then we've just taken ISG&A headcount out. We've also deployed technology in certain areas. These were initiatives that were underway pre-COVID that are now kicking in and helping driving efficiencies. So we definitely see more runway as it relates to the margin improvement as we see revenue recovery. In the MRO business, for example, you mentioned the labor, yes, definitely not coming through labor rate relief. We have really focused on as we retool the labor force making sure that we hung on to and took care of our most experienced mechanics and we've got to focus now on limiting the amount of contract labor that we use in the operation. So that we have the most experience employee base who are able to turn a higher quality product and do it more efficiently than what we saw before. And so in the MRO business, which historically had been one of our lower margin performance received the nice gains there in terms of our income performance. And then you're absolutely right as the parts business starts to return, that historically has been a higher margin for business for us. And once that starts to kick in, at the revenue line, you'll see that flow through operating margin as well.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. That's helpful. What about just on those parts on USM. You mentioned more supplies coming available. Any detail you can give on pricing at all I mean are we talking more supply potentially flooding the market or is it still fairly price competitive and a challenge to get your hands on the good material out there whether it's some of the legacy narrow-body or current generations. Anything you could say there on pricing?
John Holmes:
Yes, I wouldn't want to get into that, just for competitive reasons, but I would just say that you really see a lot of variation between asset type at the moment.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. You mentioned some international facilities and locations you have in other potential government subsidies. Are you planning on taking any other subsidies going forward?
John Holmes:
Here in the U.S. and that represents the majority of the subsidies we taken. We were eligible to receive additional CARES money under the original program as well as under the new program. Given the strong performance of the company and our cash generation we elected not to participate in those two U.S. options. Canada and our facility in the Netherlands, for example, there are programs still available there and we continue to evaluate whether or not we'll avail ourselves for those going forward.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Last one for me. Just you've got a lot of unused capacity I think you said $400 million. What are you seeing in the marketplace for potential assets out there. Do you think there is some good opportunities? Are you looking to be sort of a consolidator here or how are you looking at the marketplace?
John Holmes:
Yes, we're paying very close attention to what's available, what would be coming available, what we would like to be available and to the extent that we find the right opportunity, we feel good about being in a strong position to execute.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan of The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.
Josh Sullivan:
Can you just talk a little bit about customer mix. I mean just as you've seen some of the recovery. Have you seen any change in new customers or old customers. Just curious what that might look like at this point?
John Holmes:
Sure. In the parts business, the majority of the activity over the last couple of quarters has really been driven by the cargo market. We don't see that changing because that's going to be a strong market for some time, but in this quarter for the first time in a while we saw meaningful inquiries. And in some cases actual orders out of our larger historical passenger. So we see them kind of re-entering the fray if you will in the parts business. In the MRO business, as we mentioned, the Canadian operations have been quieter than the U.S. operations, but you are seeing the domestic to support domestic leisure travel that activity increasing here in the U.S. in the MRO market.
Josh Sullivan:
And just one on the defense. Sorry, go ahead.
John Holmes:
And the government - as you've seen from the numbers, the government business has remained very strong this entire time we put up three quarters in a row of year-on-year growth in the government business and we remain very encouraged by the pipeline of opportunities that we see there.
Josh Sullivan:
And then just on the government business, if you got the acronym the INLA business, the helicopter contract that you got. How is that performing? Have you opened new territories or do you expect to open new operation centers going forward?
John Holmes:
Yes, the WASS contract, the INLA contract is actually performing very well. We're really happy with the way that's gone over the last several years and our customer the Department of State is also very happy with our performance. That has turned out to be a much more dynamic program than you might have thought that we might have thought when we took it on and as much as you do have locations that open and close with a fair amount of regularity. So if we go back to the early days of the program where we were publicly disclosing opening and closing every time a base, every time we went into a new location, we realized that was going to be a more frequent event that we thought we moved away from it, but there has been up and down operational tempo between locations, but the overall revenue contribution and income contribution of that program has been very stable for the last several quarters.
Josh Sullivan:
And then just one last one I mean are you expecting any additional state department funding to flow into their contract vehicle just as budgets come together here. Do you have any visibility into that?
John Holmes:
Unclear, unclear right now, but no meaningful change expected one way or the other at this moment.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is open.
Joseph DeNardi:
Thanks. Sean, I think, pre-COVID you guys have been talking about maybe 10% to 11% SG&A as a percent of sales. Is that still kind of how you're looking at the business going forward?
Sean Gillen:
Yes, I think, that's right obviously as the recovery occurs and my comments on keeping this cost structure you will see improvement on that once we start to see the topline recover.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. And then maybe John or Sean just on the DOJ settlement. Is that kind of done and gone at this point or are there any contingencies or any other kind of considerations to keep in mind with that going forward?
John Holmes:
Once we reach final agreement with the government, it will be done and gone, but we felt a little bit of work to do to finalize the settlement.
Operator:
The next question comes from Ken Herbert of Canaccord. Your line is open. Mr. Herbert, your line is open.
Ken Herbert:
I just wanted to follow-up. In prior quarters you talked about more outsourcing by airlines sort of coming out of a crisis like this. Are you expecting sort of a similar playbook now and I guess my question would be, if you do expect more outsourcing by the airlines especially around the MRO side. Is your comments around being more selective in the work you take on maybe implying that for you it's not as much now about sort of a topline growth in MRO and taking advantage of those opportunities as it is making sure it's the right opportunity to maybe air on the side of margin expansion?
John Holmes:
It's definitely the latter. I wouldn't necessarily relate those two things to more work hitting the market as a result of outsourcing, but the latter is true. We are very focused on maintaining and expanding the margin gains that we've seen over the last few quarters and that leads to just being a bit more selective about the work we take on. And really focusing on increasing the throughput on a smaller footprint than we had pre-COVID. As you remember, we did close one of our sites unfortunately a difficult decision to do, but that has allowed us to achieve more efficiency across the remaining network.
Ken Herbert:
And as you think about the increased focus maybe on margins. Does it ever reach a point where maybe the benefits of the MRO business in terms of customer face time and the other synergies you've talked about maybe you're no longer quite worthy investment I mean how do we think about the potential for a more significant shift and mix of the business moving forward?
John Holmes:
We still believe in the connection between the MRO business and the rest of our businesses and certainly feel even better about that as we look to continue to improve the margin performance of the MRO businesses. That's a very dynamic market. And so we always going to be on our toes there in terms of how we win and how we perform and what goes on there from a competitive standpoint, but we were still fans of the connection between MRO and the parts of the programs business.
Operator:
Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Holmes for any closing remarks.
John Holmes:
Great. Well, thank you, everybody. I really appreciate the time and the interest. And stay safe and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Operator:
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may all disconnect. Have a great day."

December 17, 2020
Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2021 Second Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in the company's news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, and Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2020. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you all joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal 2021 results. Before we discuss the results themselves, I would like to thank all of our employees for the continued resiliency and courage they have shown over the last three quarters as we have navigated this pandemic. In particular, more than two-thirds of our people are essential workers, and they have continued to come to work every day, enabling us to continue to deliver for our customers. I'm very proud of our entire team. I also want to thank Congress once again for its work on the CARES Act, which has allowed companies like ours to preserve their skilled workforce. Regarding the business, as we indicated last quarter, overall, we have seen our commercial volumes stabilize and continued strong performance out of our government business. While we remain in a difficult and uncertain environment, we are encouraged by the stabilization as well as the positive developments regarding the vaccines, which not only will protect our people, but should also ultimately lead to more travel and a recovery in our commercial markets. With that, turning to the quarter, our sales decreased 28% year-over-year from $561 million to $404 million, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 52% from $0.64 per share to $0.31 per share. Our sales to commercial customers decreased 48%, and our sales to government and defense customers increased 13%. For the quarter, sales to government and defense customers were 52% of our total sales. Our Aviation Services segment grew 6% sequentially from our first quarter. This was a result of increased volume in our MRO business, which is seasonally higher in Q1 over -- Q2 over Q1 as well as the continued strength of our government business. Our commercial parts volumes overall were relatively stable throughout the quarter and remained above the lows we saw in April and May. That said, I am particularly encouraged by our margin improvement progress. Over the last several quarters, we have reduced our footprint across the enterprise, decreased our indirect and overhead spending, exited or restructured several underperforming contracts and divested a loss-making non-core business. You are now starting to see the results of these actions in our adjusted operating margins, which improved meaningfully from 2.5% to 4% sequentially on stable revenue. With respect to cash, we generated $28 million from operating activities from continuing operations and also reduced our accounts receivable financing program by nearly $7 million, further improving our already strong balance sheet position and putting our net leverage below 1x EBITDA. We also continue to add significant new business that positions us for growth going forward. Our CFM56 partnership with Fortress solidifies a source of supply to meet growing demand for used serviceable material on the -5B and the -7B engine variants. We expect demand for USM to increase across the board as we emerge from the pandemic and to be particularly strong for these engine platforms. Also, our follow-on contract from the Navy to support the C-40 aircraft recognizes our performance over the last five years and provides for an expanded statement of work over the next five years. It's worth noting that this was the first time that this contract was awarded to an incumbent, which speaks to the high quality of our service. Additionally, our 10-year agreement with Honeywell to be its sole authorized service center for 737 MAX Electronic Bleed Air System components positions us to support MAX operators worldwide when that aircraft to return to service. These new contracts, along with others we have announced over the last several months, such as the Unison expansion and extension, represent nearly $1.7 billion in total contract value captured so far this fiscal year. This demonstrates the unique value of our Aviation Services offering, and these business wins will help accelerate our recovery coming out of the downturn. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Sean Gillen, to review the quarter's results in more detail.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $403.6 million were down 28%, or $157.3 million year-over-year, driven by the impact of the pandemic on commercial passenger flying activity. Sequentially, Aviation Services sales were up 5.9%, or $21.4 million, while sales in Expeditionary Services were down 50%, or $18.6 million. The sequential decline in Expeditionary Services was driven by two factors. First, the exit of the composites business was completed at the end of Q1, and this business generated $7 million of revenue in Q1 and 0 in the current quarter. Second, as previously discussed, mobility had a particularly strong Q1 due to elevated shipments of pallets. Within Aviation Services, our government and defense business was up 19%, or $30 million year-over-year, reflecting strong performance on existing contracts. In the quarter as well as in Q1, our program to deliver two C-40 aircraft to the U.S. Marine Corps generated strong revenue due to elevated activity on the program. Gross profit margin in the quarter increased to 17.2% from 15.3% in the prior year quarter, driven by the CARES Act payroll support. On a sequential basis, gross profit margin was up from 12.1% in our first quarter, reflecting the actions we have taken to reduce our indirect costs and to exit underperforming contracts and product lines. SG&A expenses were $43.4 million for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $38 million, or 9.4% of sales, down $13 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting the reduction of our overhead cost structure. Of this improvement, approximately $3.2 million was the result of temporary reductions in compensation and benefits, which we restored beginning on December 1. As an update on our previous disclosure, we have been in settlement discussions with the Department of Justice regarding an investigation of airlift under the False Claims Act. During the quarter, we recorded $6 million of additional accrual and discontinued operations, which brings our total reserve for this matter to $8 million based on our latest settlement offer. We generated $27.6 million of cash in our operating activities from continuing operations for the quarter. This is net of a use of cash of $6.8 million as we continue to reduce the size of our accounts receivable financing program. Excluding the accounts receivable financing program, cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $34.4 million. Inventory decreased $12.7 million during the quarter. Our net debt at quarter-end was $112.1 million, down $37 million from $149.3 million at the end of Q1. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong with net leverage of 0.95x adjusted EBITDA, unrestricted cash of $110 million and unused capacity under our revolver of approximately $390 million. As such, we're well positioned to fund what we expect to be unique opportunities to grow our business over the coming quarters. Thank you for your attention. And I'll now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. Overall, we are pleased with our results given the current environment and also pleased with the progress we have made in improving our operating efficiency. As I mentioned, for many reasons, we are encouraged by the multiple vaccines coming to market and the plans for distribution. As the vaccines are distributed and case numbers decline, we expect travel restrictions to be lifted and people to start flying again. Until then, we expect to be in a relatively stable revenue environment, and we will continue to focus on driving cash flow as well as continued margin improvement. We will also remain focused on capturing new business, and I am confident that our strong balance sheet, combined with the airlines' increasing desire for our lower-cost value-added services, will lead to even more growth opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert Spingarn:
Hey, good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hey, Rob, how are you?
Robert Spingarn:
Good. Thanks. And nice margin improvement there. John, I want to talk about just -- well, I've got a couple of things I want to go over. But how did the quarter look month-by-month? It looks like you've already seen trough, at least by a little bit here. This was a little bit up from last quarter. So I assume we're done with that, and we're heading north on the revenues. But how did that look quarter-to-quarter -- month-to-month?
John Holmes:
Yes. It was actually -- it was fairly stable throughout the quarter. I would agree that we've seen the trough. The parts volumes, the MRO volumes had all come up from what we saw in the April and May timeframe. But heading into the June, July period, the volumes that we saw across the business were relatively stable in the months following.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then to what extent can we glean anything from whatever conversations you're having with customers as they think about the return of MAX to service, the maybe modest increase in production rate of the MAX? Airbus has talked about perhaps lifting the production rate on the A320. As -- and obviously, traffic we all think is going to come back here. Have they talked to you a little bit about how they expect the fleet to move in response to all of that? And how, if at all, does that affect your MRO schedule and your anticipation more USM becoming available if new lift starts to replace old lift?
John Holmes:
Yes. And really – it depends on the customers. Certainly, you've seen some of the larger carriers that have MAXs on order, they've gone ahead and started taking delivery of those MAXs. Customers that have MAX already in their fleet, they've begun operating those. So those customers appear to be committed to that path. Broader though, as you know, you've seen -- you have seen a number of cancellations of the MAX. And the corresponding theme is that we have seen customers, at the same time, they're going to introduce new aircraft. They've also indicated to us that they do expect to hold on to some older aircraft longer than they would have anticipated over throughout COVID. All of them though, I should say, have expressed -- and again, this is customers that are current USM customers, as well as customers in regions like China that are not USM customers, we have seen an interest across the board in USM material. And during the quarter, we did start to see more aircraft become available for acquisition and ultimately for teardown. So that chain of events where you see an aircraft put on the ground, then ultimately retired, then ultimately sold potentially to someone like us who might tear it down, you've seen a bit more of that come into the market. And therefore, we expect the supply to start increasing.
Robert Spingarn:
Now are those aircraft that you're starting to see, are those CEOs and NGs? Or are we talking about older airplanes that really overhauling those wouldn't make any sense, the models that are going really out to pasture?
John Holmes:
Yes. No, we've -- and I don't want to get too much into detail for competitive reasons, but we've seen a pretty wide range of opportunities, I would say.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then just quickly, a couple of other things. Just if we end up a couple of years down the road with a simplified fleet of, let's call it, A320ceos and neos, 220s, 350s; and then on the Boeing side, MAX and NG, 777, 787 and everything else is gone, is that better for third-party maintenance or worse?
John Holmes:
I think overall, it's -- I mean, I would view it as a positive. I mean, we -- companies like ours exist to provide a necessary service. I mean that maintenance capability has largely been outsourced by most of the carriers. And unless you see a compelling event for them to start in-sourcing that activity, we believe that the volume of work will continue to exist for third-party maintenance providers and us, in particular.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then just last one on margins. You mentioned that you see continued margin improvement. I think if we go back to your prior -- your previous higher margins, you were doing that in a period of time you had higher SG&A, and you also had some contract labor, which we assume is more expensive. So if we look forward, and you don't have those two things, how do we think about what margins can do? Is there an incremental margin that you or Sean suggest we be using as we look at revenues rise here?
John Holmes:
We would expect that we will come out of this crisis at higher operating margins than we were pre-COVID.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay.
John Holmes:
And -- yes. And that's due to a number of factors, largely to the actions that we've taken. But your point on contract labor is right on. We've done a number of things to reset activities inside of our hangars, and we do not expect to be as reliant on contract labor going forward as we had been in the past. That's certainly a contributor. We have a number of other efficiency initiatives under -- that we're in the process of implementing inside the hangars, so that we'll be a lot more efficient as that volume of work comes back. But then additionally, there were a number of less profitable activities or unprofitable activities that existed at the company pre-COVID. And over the last three quarters, we've done a lot of work to eliminate that drag from our earnings. And as we recover the stronger performance out of our parts businesses, for example, as well as increased efficiency in the hangar, you'll start to see that come through in better margins.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Excellent. Thank you.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Rob.
Operator:
And thank you. And our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. John, can you just talk a little bit about maybe the conversations that you've been having with some of your airline customers in terms of how they're thinking about capacity recovery and specifically how those conversations may have changed in the last few weeks after the vaccine news and kind of how they're thinking about summer of 2021 schedules and capacity?
John Holmes:
Sure. Again, you're in a situation where the conversation varies by customer. But the general themes are there is a focus on summer 2021 readiness. And what was different about the quarter we went through versus our first quarter, during the summer, if you recall, we went through another surge, not nearly as significant as the surge we're in now, but there was another surge. And at that point, we did see quite a bit of movement in the maintenance schedule in parts volume behavior out of the customer base. We did not see and have not seen that same movement in behavior as we've gone through this most recent surge. As the customers appear to be focused, ""Okay, we're going to have some ups and downs over the next few months. But at the end of the day, the vaccine will get distributed. There's pent-up demand for leisure travel, and we want to be ready for that in summer 2021."" So while the, I would say, the level of expectation over -- of increase in summer 2021 travel over summer 2020 varies by customer, overall, the customers expect to have a better summer in 2021 than they did in 2020, and they want to be ready for it.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. And then can you just walk us through maybe the three legs of your commercial business? So where each one is kind of on the road to recovery? And then structurally, what's changed about each of the three in terms of kind of how big they can be on the other side of this and whether they're going to be structurally smaller for a period of time, if that makes sense?
John Holmes:
Sure. I mean in terms of overall size, and I would go back to what we mentioned earlier. We expect to be in a relatively stable revenue environment until you see a meaningful increase in flying activities. But at the same time, we remain very focused on continuing to improve our margins in that stable environment. If I take the 3 areas of the commercial business, in the parts business, both new and used parts, as we mentioned earlier, we've seen relatively stable activity. We have had, what I would call, kind of higher highs, if you will, during the last few weeks, which is encouraging. But still, overall, we would expect stable activity in the commercial parts business. Coming out of the crisis, as we've talked about, we definitely expect increased demand for the USM business. We're really excited about our partnership with Fortress. That's one of many initiatives we have going on right now on the USM side. But I would expect that business to potentially be structurally larger than it was pre-COVID depending on how demand shakes out. Similarly, on the new parts distribution business, we continue to add new distributorship. There are a number of opportunities out there that we are evaluating for new parts distributorships with different OEMs. Much like the airlines, the OEMs have -- they're taking a look at their approach to the aftermarket. And similarly, as they think about their cost structures, we are seeing some interest from OEMs that previously might not have considered a distribution partner, now they are looking at a distribution partner. And so we're evaluating that -- those opportunities. And we think that, that business could also emerge larger thanks to new business wins as well as same-store sales, if you will, increase on the agreements that we had prior to COVID. In the MRO business, I would say that we feel very good about the footprint that we have. We took out capacity, which was a very difficult decision, but we took out capacity by closing our Duluth facility as well as rationalize our footprint inside of other facilities that are still in the network. And we believe that ultimately, we'll get a better yield out of that footprint than we did pre-COVID because of some of the changes that we've made. And finally, on the commercial programs business, that's a business where we've made a lot of changes over the last several quarters. As we've talked about, we've exited or restructured underperforming contracts. The majority of that work is now behind us. We feel good about the remaining contract portfolio. And I believe we talked about this last quarter, but that market had seen a lot of pricing pressure pre-COVID. And you've seen a number of the participants in that market make move either to exit the market entirely or also like us, exit underperforming contracts. And we believe that you could see pricing in that market reset post-COVID. And to the extent that it does, and we believe that we can earn a return, we'll be a participant in that market.
Joseph DeNardi:
That's great. So John, it's fair to say that kind of the highest margin leg for you all will be bigger and that the two lower margin legs will probably be smaller for a period?
John Holmes:
Yes.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. And then just two quick follow-ups on MRO. Have you seen any indications from airlines that they may be able to outsource more than they were able to pre-COVID in terms of the concessions that they've been able to get? And then in terms of what you've done to rationalize capacity, is that enough to fix the margin challenge that you all had at MRO pre-COVID? Or do you still face some of the challenges that you had, I guess, pre-COVID once we're through this?
John Holmes:
Sure. In terms of work, I mean all of our customers are reevaluating their operating models. I mean you have to, going through a shock like we've been through. So we're having a variety of conversations, both with existing customers, and as you point out, with customers that may not have pursued an outsourced model to the extent that they may consider now. So there's a lot of moving parts there. And then as it relates to the operating efficiency inside of the hangars, yes, we feel very good about the changes that we have made. We believe the footprint that we have is the right footprint to take the work that we expect to get over the next few quarters as well as the increased volumes as the overall market recovers. And we do expect much greater yield out of the labor hours that we produce based on the efficiency that we've built in. Again, there's a lot of moving pieces there, and we're extremely grateful for the support of our customers through this, and we're very excited to continue to provide the maintenance services to them as they recover.
Operator:
And our next question comes from Ken Herbert from Canaccord.
Ken Herbert:
John, I just wanted to first see if you can provide or what other details you can provide on the agreement with Fortress for the CFM, the 5 and the 7B engines? And I guess specifically, timing you expect to start to see some of the engines come through, assuming we start to see some demand at some point for the material? And how we should think about the ramp of this agreement as it relates into your broader sort of USM opportunity?
John Holmes:
Sure. Thanks for asking about that. We're very excited about the partnership with Fortress. We've worked with Fortress for many years and have a great respect for what the team over there is doing in the industry. This agreement really plays to both of our strengths. They've got a very large and growing engine lease pool, and we are the #1 participant in the USM space. So the agreement basically calls for us to manage engines through a teardown process out of their engine pool, and we have complete control over that management. Some of the material will be sold back to Fortress for use in their own engine build, and the rest of the material will be sold by us into the aftermarket. And there are volume commitments between us and Fortress, and those volume commitments will be a meaningful increase through our aftermarket parts activity. And these are core engine platforms as you know. So we're excited to be a participant -- an even bigger participant in that market. As it relates to timing, we would expect volume -- to see volume later this fiscal year, and then it would grow throughout our FY '22.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. And as I think about, is this a -- would you consider this sort of an asset-light agreement? Or are you actually going to be committing working capital to maybe buy some of the engines and materials ahead of time?
John Holmes:
It's an asset-light agreement. We'll be investing in repairs, but not the assets themselves.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. Great. And as I think about, if we sort of walk back from a -- hopefully, a summer or mid-'21 recovery in traffic, and you think about airlines' behaviors, is it fair to say that you would see this first in your MRO schedules and then maybe second in the surplus material and then your distribution business might be the last to see the uptick as airlines actually start to buy material again? Or is there a better way to think about the cadence of the impact on your business ahead of what should be an improvement?
John Holmes:
Historically, what I -- historically, what you just said, I would agree with that. Coming out of this downturn, just because it's been so broad and extended and because of the significant deferred maintenance, particularly on engines that has built up over the last several months, it's possible that we could see concurrent recovery between the parts business as well as the heavy maintenance business or the parts business could lead the recovery. Right now, the loading that we have in the hangars is relatively consistent over the next couple of quarters. But as the -- as our customers have better visibility into their demand going into summer '21, you could see that change as well.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. So it sounds like -- based on that comment, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like you don't view green time on engines, in particular, as sort of a major overhang to the pace of the recovery.
John Holmes:
I think we're burning green time now. And so -- yes. And so we're looking at, ultimately, as that green times come down, the deferred balances growing, if you will, and that would require more parts sooner.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. But I guess the question, as that deferred doesn't sort of spill into -- they're not able to defer theoretically for much of '21 if you see a recovery at some point earlier in '21. It sounds like that green time and that deferred opportunity will largely have run its course theoretically if we do get a recovery in mid-'21.
John Holmes:
Yes. I mean you got a lot of moving parts there, but that could be true.
Operator:
And our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli from Truist.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Good margin performance. John, I guess just to maybe stay on kind of Ken's line of questioning and that recovery. I know you said the revenues likely stay stable until we see a pickup in travel utilization, most likely take off and landings. And you just kind of said that loading looks consistent. But if these airlines and your customers are going to be ready for, let's knock on wood, a normalized '21 summer, shouldn't we see a pretty big uptick in activity ahead of that? I mean as you guys look at it, do you think like the May quarter ahead of that busy flying season, you start to see that revenue inflection before we see the uptick in kind of all that pent-up demand and traffic uptick?
John Holmes:
You very well could. Our stable outlook right now reflects what the commitments are that we have. To the extent that the customers see increased booking and they see that demand increase, then you're absolutely right, there could be more demand. I don't know that any of our customers right now are expecting a return to normal levels of flying in summer '21. I think that they're expecting certainly an increase in '21 over '20, but I think many of them are still -- have modest expectations. Having said that though, I mean the situation continues to evolve very quickly. I know our customers, they -- bookings and cancellations are happening in real time for them. And so they don't have a lot of visibility in the demand. So I think as soon as they have a clearer picture of summer '21, they absolutely could be calling for more maintenance and more parts.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Yes. And then by no means did I suggest a normal '21, but just maybe improved. But I guess what -- the customer conversations, I mean, things are -- with this surge, I mean things are going to be bad here in December, might get worse in January, February. I mean how are these conversations? Can you give us any insight into how things are evolving? I mean are there more areas of risk that you see? I mean you talked about the loading. But I mean are there pressure points at some of your customers? Or are they all pretty much planning for, ""Okay, capacity demand is going to be weaker for the next couple of months, but we're thinking beyond this short-term impact."" So are they thinking more along the lines of, ""Hey, our plans are pretty stable and firm regardless of what happens,"" or is it just still totally fluid out there?
John Holmes:
I think what you just said -- the next to last thing that you said is, ""Okay, it's going to be a bit of an up and down patch here for the next few months, but we need to look past that and be ready for summer '21."" And I believe that at least the commitments that they have made to us that they are based on what I'll call kind of a conservative case of what they expect summer '21 flying to be. In other words, they're committing to us because they know that, for example, the maintenance business, we need to have solid lines of maintenance to keep the team together and keep them working. And so right now, they've committed to a level of loading that they know they can hit. To the extent that they end up with a better summer, they may require more maintenance. We just haven't seen that order book form up yet.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. And then just back to the MRO, you talked about the footprint, the efficiencies there, better yields. Is there also -- I mean at one point, labor was extremely tight. Are you getting more experienced mechanics in there? Is there any benefit you're seeing from just hourly wages you're having to pay? Or is it just strictly tied to those footprint reductions that's helping your yield there?
John Holmes:
Yes. Good question. So far, wages have remained relatively stable. We have, I think, done a really nice job of retaining and recruiting a much more experienced workforce. And that experienced workforce is delivering great results for our customers in terms of quality and turnaround time performance. And so as I mentioned earlier, our reliance on contract waiver is much reduced from where it was pre-COVID. and that is a ratio that we are really focused on preserving. And that's one of the reasons during this time -- that's the main reason we took CARES Act funding. It's -- we've done everything we can, whether we're furloughing people or in the worst case, we've had to let people go, thinking maybe one day, we'd need them back. We've done everything that we can to treat our people the best as we can throughout this period. And what Sean mentioned, one of the decisions that we made a few weeks ago was to restore salaries and benefits for our workforce so that it all levels in the company. Whether you're in an office or in a hangar, you've -- your pay has been restored, and we can keep the team together. So we're doing everything we can to treat our people well, and I think that's going to serve us well in the marketplace as we go out and continue to build the workforce, and we'll be able to get the best talent available.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. That's helpful. And then just the last one, just back to that Fortress agreement. I think you talked about investing in repairs. You're also selling parts. Any color on the margin profile? I mean I would think, obviously, the parts sales would be much higher margin. How should we think about the repair component there? Is it more higher margin than your typical MRO, given it might be obviously engine accessory-type repairs? Or it sounds like it's going to be a margin-accretive opportunity, but any more color you can share there?
John Holmes:
Yes. I would just say that we don't want to get into the margins, the particular details around that specific agreement. But I would say again that we're excited about it, and it will be -- it will, over time, become a meaningful part of our USM business.
Operator:
And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for further remarks.
John Holmes:
Okay. Well, thank you very much. We really appreciate everyone's time and interest. And stay safe and want to wish everybody a happy holiday.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

September 24, 2020
Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to AAR’s Fiscal 2021 First Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in the company’s news release and the Risk Factors section of the company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR’s President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2021 results. Before reviewing the quarter, I would like to express my continued gratitude to AAR’s employees. The majority of our people have continue to come to work every day throughout the pandemic to ensure AAR’s uninterrupted support of its customers, and I am grateful for their dedication and commitment, and proud of our team’s ability to continue to navigate a truly unprecedented decline in commercial passenger flying. Turning to the results, our sales for the quarter decreased 26% from $542 million to $401 million and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 70% from $0.57 per share to $0.17 per share. Our total sales to commercial customers decreased 48% from the prior year, while sales to government and defense customers increased 10%, reflecting new contract awards and significant shipments out of our Mobility business against the previously announced $125 million Cargo Pallets contract. For the quarter, sales to government and defense customers were 56% of the total. In response to the current environment, we have taken a number of actions to align our costs with the lower levels of demand. But we have also gone further to position the company for improved margins as demand recovers. Over the last three years, we have consolidated three -- or three quarters we have consolidated three facilities, a permanent reductions to our fixed and variable costs, and exited or restructured several underperforming contracts. We have also taken steps to focus on our core aviation services offering by completing the divestitures of our Airlift and Composites businesses. All of these actions have simplified our portfolio, improved efficiency in our operations and set us up to drive higher returns on capital. In addition to this progress, we continue to win new business during the quarter. We announced a three-year contract with the Royal Netherlands Air Force to repair F-16 jet fuel starters. We also announced two new contracts won by our Airinmar subsidiary, which provides component repair cycle management and aircraft warranty solutions. We were selected by both Frontier Airlines and Air Methods, the world’s largest civilian helicopter operator to provide a full suite of warranty and value engineering services. In addition to the wins this quarter, we saw stabilization in certain of our businesses. Our order volume and trading and distribution were consistent throughout the quarter at a level above what we saw in April and May, but well below pre-COVID levels. In our MRO business as we head into the fall, we incurred -- we are encouraged by the loading we expect to see in our hangers. While our customers continue to operate in an uncertain environment and their maintenance schedules could change, the early indications are positive relative to our earlier expectations. We are in a constant contact with our commercial customers globally and are continuing to look for ways to support them during this difficult time. In our Government business, where we saw growth during the quarter, we continue to pursue new opportunities and the pipeline remains full. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Sean Gillen.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. As John mentioned, we continue to take action to reduce our costs and exit underperforming activities in the quarter. These actions and other items resulted in predominantly non-cash pretax charges of $37.3 million. Also as previously disclosed, we received financial aid under the CARES Act in the quarter. The total amount received was $57.2 million, of which $48.5 million was a grant and $8.7 million was a low interest pre-payable loan. In the quarter, we utilized $8 million of the CARES Act grant and $3 million of other non-U.S. government labor subsidies for a total of $11 million. This amount is included in the GAAP income statement but excluded from adjusted earnings. As of the quarter end, the unutilized portion of the grant was $40.8 million, which was recorded as a current liability. This amount will flow through the P&L as it is utilized, which we expect to be complete by mid-Q4. Turning to some additional financial detail in the quarter, SG&A expense was $45.3 million for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $39.7 million, down $10.5 million from the prior year quarter, which reflects the reduction of our overhead cost structure. In the quarter, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was 9.9%. Net interest expense for the quarter was $1.6 million, compared to $2.1 million last year, which reflects the lower interest rate in the period. During the quarter, we generated $39.8 million of cash in our operating activities from continuing operations. This includes the $45 million grant portion of the CARES Act funding and a net use of cash of $18.6 million as we reduce the level of our accounts receivable financing program. Excluding the CARES Act and accounts receivable financing program impacts, cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $9.9 million. Additionally, as we are focused on lowering our working capital, we were able to reduce inventory by $19 million during the quarter. Also, we repaid $355 million of our revolving credit facility during the quarter. We had previously drawn the full balance as a precautionary measure. Our net debt at quarter end was $149.3 million and unrestricted cash was $107.7 million. Our balance sheet remains strong with net leverage of 1.1 times and availability under our revolver of approximately $355 million and we have no near-term maturities. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. In light of the current macro environment, we are pleased with our Q1 performance. Our Government business continues to be healthy, our cargo end markets continue to generate demand and our balance sheet remains strong. As discussed on the Q4 call, given the uncertainty in the market, at this stage, we are not providing guidance for the rest of the year. Having said that, looking forward more generally, although, the trajectory of the recovery remains uncertain, we expect the aftermarket to recover faster than the OEM market. Within the aftermarket, we expect use serviceable material, in which AAR is the global leader to be prioritized by operators over higher cost alternatives. We also expect to see more material become available to support this demand as aircraft are permanently retired and parted it out. This along with the maintenance deferrals occurring for both airframe and engine should drive an increased need for services out of our Trading, Distribution and MRO businesses as the commercial market recovers. While the timing of the recovery is unknown, we believe that the actions we have taken and are continuing to take to adjust our cost structure and reposition our portfolio, combined with the strength of our team, the airline’s need for lower cost solutions and our balance sheet, uniquely position us to benefit from an eventual return of demand and to emerge an even stronger and more profitable company. With that, I’d like to turn it back over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn:
Hey. Good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hey, Rob. How are you?
Robert Spingarn:
Good. Thanks. Thanks, John and Sean. Couple of questions. So, you mentioned that you are encouraged and you are seeing some positives. Could you talk a little bit, John, about the volumes as they progressed in the various businesses, but primarily just commercial overall through the quarter-by-month? And should I interpret your comments, you are more bullish now at this point than you were three months ago?
John Holmes:
Sure. Yeah. Let me -- I will talk through the businesses. Thinking about the parts business -- trading and distribution -- we did see relatively consistent performance from each of those businesses in terms of order volume, each month during the quarter. MRO did improve through the quarter. And August, for example, was a better month than June. We expect MRO to improve from the Q1 level as we head into Q2. What we meant by being encouraged is -- yeah, as we sat here three months ago, we didn’t have clear visibility, and I would say, had lower expectations of the MRO loading that we expected to see in the second quarter as we head into the fall and in the winter. And so far, the indications from our customers are better than we expected at the beginning of Q1.
Robert Spingarn:
Is there any way to quantify the loading in MRO in terms of the percentage, utilization of your Hanger capacity, let’s say, in the fiscal one versus what you are expecting in fiscal two and so on?
John Holmes:
I would say that we certainly look at it in terms of labor hours that we produced. Q2 will be a better quarter in that regard than Q1, but still well below what we produced a year ago. Beyond that, at this point, I wouldn’t want to give any specifics. What I would say is that, as you are talking and seeing from all of the commercial airline, there continues to be quite a bit of movement out there in terms of what they expect in the way of demand, and certainly, headlines in the last few days would indicate there’s things going on in Europe, et cetera. And questions about what could happen here in the U.S. But at this point, we have got pretty good dialog and reasonable visibility to what we expect to see in the second quarter.
Robert Spingarn:
And would MRO reflect the down -- I think it was 48% commercial volume decreases. When we think about the number of hours in fiscal quarter one, is it similar to that or is there something…
John Holmes:
Yeah. I would say, in MRO, yeah, I would say, it’s consistent to that in Q1.
Robert Spingarn:
And that that improves a bit in Q2.
John Holmes:
Yeah.
Robert Spingarn:
Are airlines positioning for a return in traffic in calendar ‘21, is that what drives your Q2?
John Holmes:
Yeah. We are seeing some positioning for holiday travel. So, that’s typically what drives the demand in the fall. And then the demand that we see throughout the winter and the spring is getting ready for summer travel. And we are seeing a lot of movement inside the airlines as much as -- on the one hand, they want to conserve cash and be conservative. On the other hand, they don’t want to miss out to the extent that there is an increase in bookings and they have the ability to add more routes.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then just lastly, you touched on this at the end before. You mentioned the significance of USM in the recovery. So just, can we get a little bit more specific about the trends that you have been seeing, have owners and operators started to make decisions about parting out? I think last time we convened here, they hadn’t gotten to that point yet.
John Holmes:
Yeah.
Robert Spingarn:
And are new customers surfacing for USM, who previously preferred not to purchase used serviceable material?
John Holmes:
Yeah. I will answer the second part first. Yeah. We are seeing indications from customers that previously wouldn’t have been interested in aftermarket material, specifically over in Asia that are now -- appear to be more receptive to that and we do expect that to be a trend. Going back to the first part of the question, there does seem to be a disconnect out there between announced fleet reductions and actual retirements. We haven’t seen as many actual retirements as we would expect at this point. And therefore, we actually haven’t seen as many aircraft go to part out, as we would expect at this point, but we do anticipate that. We are in a very fortunate position with our balance sheet that once we do start to see aircraft that are appealing to us, come available, we are in a position to make those investments once we have a clear sense of what the market is going to look like.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Thank you, John.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Rob.
Operator:
And thank you. And our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Joseph DeNardi:
Yeah. Good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hey, Joe. How are you?
Joseph DeNardi:
John -- yeah, doing well. I appreciate kind of the lack of confidence, I guess, in terms of providing guidance on the commercial business. But you guys highlight how much of the business comes from the defense side and one of the strength there, obviously, is the visibility. So could you provide some framework around what you are expecting in terms of revenue and gross profit for the defense side, for the year?
John Holmes:
Yeah. At this point, we expect relatively consistent performance throughout the year. Our defense business has held up well, both on the transactional side, meaning the defense element of our distribution, and certainly, the program activity. You did see some movement this quarter. We saw really nice improvement out of mobility, as we mentioned. I would characterize that as elevated activity this quarter. We would expect to see that return to more normal levels in subsequent quarters. But overall, the government business is, it has been fairly consistent throughout this period and we would expect that to remain the case. Having said all that, we do have, as I mentioned, a robust pipeline of bids as well as RFPs that we are responding to. So, there’s still quite a lot of activity out there in the government space, everything is moving very slowly right now. COVID, it’s slow to begin with and we have talked a lot about, obviously the protest complications when we go after these new contracts. But COVID has definitely slowed things down in the acquisition world, in the government. So that’s slowing things, but there are wins that that could convert and contribute to this fiscal year. And to the extent that we are successful in any of those, we will certainly announce it and discuss how it might improve the results further.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. That’s helpful. And then, Sean, could you maybe just help in terms of maybe providing gross margins between commercial and defense? And given the size of Expeditionary, it’s kind of challenging to model that. So could you provide a little bit of visibility in terms of the gross margins between the two businesses, commercial and defense and then is the 12% gross margin sustainable at these volumes, and if volumes get better, gross margin should get better as well, is that a fair way to think about it?
Sean Gillen:
Yeah. So, just on the gross margin, yeah, you did see that uptick in Expeditionary Services, the majority of which came from the mobility business. Within Aviation Services, you saw margin degradation down to 12% from 15% in the previous year. Government really was relatively flat. So a lot of that degradation came from the weakness in the commercial topline. So that will give you a bit of a picture of margin year-over-year between commercial activities and government. And I would expect that government, excluding that mobility piece, should largely be consistent for the year.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. And then, John, could you maybe just talk about the Frontier award, maybe when that conversation started and just maybe more about, kind of, in general the conversations that airlines are having, have they shifted from pure survival mode to let’s try and plan for what we actually think things could look like on the other side of this? Thank you.
John Holmes:
Yeah. Sure. I guess two thoughts there. It really depends on the customer in terms of where they are. With certain customers that we speak to and this is -- these are global comments. It’s very much a survival conversation with other customers though we are having, I would say, very progressive conversations about how our solutions can help them. And that’s certainly with existing customers and relatively new customers, like, Frontier, we had a relationship with Frontier to varying degrees over the years, but it’s been largely transactional in this contract. It’s not a huge contract dollar wise, but we were very happy to get something signed up on a multiyear basis with Frontier. And I would say this is -- it’s emblematic of how airlines will look towards solutions, whether that’s USM or outsourcing maintenance that they hadn’t outsourced before, et cetera. It’s emblematic of how airlines are likely going to want to be or need to be a lot more creative about how they manage their cost through this period and the Airinmar offering around warranty management and warranty claims, as well as our repair cycle management is a creative offering. So happy to see Frontier sign that contract and we will look for more of that.
Joseph DeNardi:
But it’s safe to say, John, that those conversations kind of aren’t as frequent or robust as you maybe hope they will be six months from now once there is kind of a clear line of sight into what demand looks like for airlines on the other side of it?
John Holmes:
Yeah. I would expect the conversations to become more robust as time goes on. And on that note, we have seen just in the last few weeks, there were multiple projects and multiple initiatives that we had with various customers pre-COVID. Many of those things were put on hold because of COIVD, because it was just all hands on deck. We have seen certain customers expressing interest in restarting those conversations now that they have got better stability. But again, it really does vary by the customer.
Joseph DeNardi:
Got it. Thank you.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
And thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Herbert from Canaccord. Your line is now open.
Ken Herbert:
Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, John and Sean. Just wanted to…
John Holmes:
Hi, Ken. How are you?
Ken Herbert:
Just wanted to first ask on the MRO business, I mean, if you do see the loading, like the airlines are currently indicating. Are you fully staffed or is there any risk that you could see more demand then you can support and just where do you stand on the labor side to support the business?
John Holmes:
That’s a great question. We are at this point in order to meet the demand. We are calling back many of our employees who are out on furlough and actually at a couple of our sites we are hiring beyond that furlough -- the unemployed that we are bringing back from furlough. When we furloughed, of course, but if we let people go, we did our very best to make sure that with our best people that we have stayed in contact with them, and obviously, treated them right as we were downsizing and so far in the markets we are actually having reasonable success in attracting talent. This is something we have been very public about. We are very focused on all of the initiatives that we had heading into COVID. Our partnerships with schools, our training, everything that we could do to develop a proprietary pipeline of talent, we have done a very best through the last six months to keep those initiatives going, because we want to make sure that as demand recovers, we have got access to the very best talent in the industry. We are aware that there are some competitors out there that are hiring as well and we want to make sure that that AAR is the employer of choice. So sort answer to your question is, we are in the market, we are bringing people back from furlough. We are hiring net new people at certain sites and so far it’s going okay. But we are very aware of what full recovery could look like and the fact that you have had people potentially permanently leave the workforce and so we got to make sure that we are getting new talent out of the school.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. That’s helpful. And as you look at the discussions you are having now, can you provide any commentary on sort of labor rates and to the extent to it may be -- extent to which maybe you are having to make some adjustments there to reflect just the financial position of the airlines or are you able to sort of maintain rates and ideally start to drive some increase on the MRO side?
John Holmes:
Yeah. Sure. So far, broadly we have been able to maintain rates, again there are individual negotiations that happen all the time, but broadly, we have been able to maintain rates. We haven’t had meaningful discussions about raising rates at this point. As it relates to our labor costs, when we were -- we had a very high reliance on correct labor for the two years heading into COVID that was a real source of labor for us and the contract labor or flat rate teams, which is another version of contract labor. Those definitely come at a higher cost than full-time employees. As we rebuild our labor force, we are very focused on rebuilding it with full-time employees. Contract labor makes sense to an extent as you are flexing up and down, because invariably you have ups and downs inside a facility, but as a percentage, we want to be more disciplined about the overall level of contract labor that we employ in the hangars. So the cost of a full-time employee hasn’t changed. But overall, we are working on managing the -- the cost of our labor by managing the mix between full-time and contract.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. That’s very helpful. And if I could just one final question on the part side, and specifically, the USM potential. There has been some speculation recently that in fact the balance sheets of airlines may limit as they -- as capacity comes back, so they may limit in fact the number of retirements as they look to defer new deliveries. I know credits very accommodative right now. But how are you modeling sort of retirements and the availability of USM, either from a timing standpoint when you might start to expect we see this pickup? And then, ultimately, any comments on sort of how much you expect to see and is there any risk that it might come in lower than maybe we are thinking about?
John Holmes:
When you say come in lower, do you mean the number of retirements or the level of demand?
Ken Herbert:
The number of retirements, I think, demand will be pretty good, if the aftermarket continues to improve, but the availability of material?
John Holmes:
We do expect. We would, as you imagine, we have got a number of scenarios that we look at and it’s -- as you know better than anybody, it’s a very dynamic situation right now. In general, we -- sort of we expect more material availability then we saw pre-COVID and our limit to growth pre-COVID was really that material availability. But we became the -- that -- in our view, the best in the market at sourcing and getting our hands on the very best material. From that pre-COVID baseline, it’s difficult to calculate exactly how much more will be available, but we do expect net -- yeah, net new availability of aftermarket material headed into a recovery. How do you reconcile that against elevated demand again is another question. But net-net, we would expect all of that to be a positive for our aftermarket trading business.
Ken Herbert:
Great. Well, thank you very much.
John Holmes:
And only other additional comment, I would say that, if you overlay that on the -- and we mentioned this in our remarks, we do expect elevated demand coming out of the -- as we go into the recovery, because there has been so much deferred maintenance particularly on engines and that’s going to drive a great deal of, as I said, requirements.
Ken Herbert:
Great. Thank you.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli from Truist. Your line is now open.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey. Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. John, maybe just to stay on cans, that material availability, I mean how much you guys getting out there and sort of speculating in the marketplace. I know parts were extremely tight. I am just thinking about the pricing environment, and I mean, did you said, you use the term everything is pretty dynamic now. But if the MRO overall market kind of stays pretty sluggish into next year, I mean, are you comfortable going out there, sourcing all that material potentially?
John Holmes:
Our focus right now, as we mentioned, is really on working capital and we are…
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay.
John Holmes:
… very -- yeah. We are very pleased with the fact that we were able to invent -- reduce our inventory by $19 million during the quarter, and as we mentioned, after you adjust for the accounts receivable and the CARES money be $10 million cash flow positive. So we think in this environment that’s a great accomplishment and generating cash is the main focus of ours going forward. We want to make sure that that we do those things so that we have the balance sheet and the confidence. So that when we see the right material come on the market. We have got first-mover advantage and have the capital to add maneuver our competitors to pick it up at the best price.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. And what about, I have got the names -- Napier. You have the partnership…
John Holmes:
Yeah.
Michael Ciarmoli:
…with them, what’s the thought process there. I mean it seems…
John Holmes:
Yeah. That’s a…
Michael Ciarmoli:
Yeah.
John Holmes:
That’s a great point. That is a joint venture that’s still in place. There is a great deal of dry powder associated with that joint venture. We are in very regular dialog with our partners who are very aware of all the dynamics in the market right now and that also could be a source of capital to acquire aircraft that are on lease and keep them on lease for a period of time or acquire aircraft on sublease that could also -- that ultimately be used for the trading business. But again, there is still moving -- so some moving parts right now are focused on building up our own cash position, so that we can make moves when we feel confident in the pricing.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Just shifting gears. Some of the charges, I think $0.18 tied to rotable asset impairment and customer contract. Can you give us a little more detail, were those, I guess, the customer contracts, were those underperforming bad contracts or -- and same thing with the assets, were they tied to legacy aircraft or just a little bit more color on those charges?
Sean Gillen:
Yeah. And you are right there, on the exited contract that was an underperforming contract, a bit in the same vein of some actions we have taken over the past couple of quarters that we are trying to take this opportunity to exit underperforming contracts where it makes sense. So, that’s what the exited contract is. And then the rotable asset impairment, as you recall, the rotable asset support the programs activities and as we have -- the flight hours have come down and as we have exited certain programs. We took a look at the assets we had in place and ones that were no longer supporting the programs, mark them to fair value. So, that’s what that -- the impairment charge is in the quarter.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. And it may be a good segue on the programs. I mean, I don’t remember the exact number of planes you guys had under the integrated programs. But is there any other residual financial impact we should be aware of, dramatically reduced flying hours, potentially some airlines calling their fleets, potential bankruptcies? How are you guys thinking about or handicapping that risk on the integrated programs?
John Holmes:
Yeah. It would be fair to say that we are very actively managing that portfolio. And Sean mentioned, over the last couple of quarters, we have taken action to either restructure or -- in the cases related to the charges -- completely exit underperforming contracts. Many of the program customers, their fleets are still in flux. It’s not completely clear how they will come back in the complexion of those fleets. And we are working very closely with those customers to -- if it makes sense to restructure the contract and keep it in place to support wherever they land on the new fleet composition and their expected flying hours, we will work with them to do that. However, if it’s going to be too far out of bounds from what we contemplated when we signed the agreement, we are going to exit. I’d say the majority of lift, the heavy lifting in that portfolio has been done. But there still are some customers that we are in dialog with right now.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. Okay. Got it. And then just the last one, I guess, with the commercial revenues declining 48%. I know you are not going to give guidance, but do you think we have sort of bottomed here on Aviation or do you think we will see a sequential decline as we go into the next quarter?
John Holmes:
We feel good about the fact that the bookings in Q1 were above and were stable at a level above where they were in Q4. And it’s difficult to predict whether or not that’s the bottom. Certainly, there is -- it all depends on people’s confidence, supplying and the virus and the vaccine, et cetera, et cetera. But the last several months have been consistent in our parts businesses and we talked a lot about the maintenance business. So, at this point, unless there is a second wave that throws things off, I would expect that that we have seen -- we saw the bottom in Q4.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. And that’s still consistent even though we are seeing carriers kind of reduce their planned capacity and nothing -- it still seems like things are progressing and improving despite kind of the messaging we are seeing, whether it’s Ryanair or some of -- JetBlue, the other day, as they are dialing down their capacity?
John Holmes:
Yeah. From the order volume that we see and particularly the loading in the hangars from our larger customers, reflects their current view on the fleet. But as we have said over and over again, that could change. We are seeing less movement in maintenance schedules, et cetera, than we did a quarter ago. But still -- I think still it’s very dynamic.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. All right. Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Operator:
Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Sullivan from The Benchmark Company.
Josh Sullivan:
Hey. Good afternoon, John, Sean. Just on the freighter conversion market, what do you think that that cycle looks like? Is it still pretty strong, any thought? The market’s overshooting itself at some point?
John Holmes:
I think it’s still pretty strong. I think that’s a great point that you might be getting to the stage where it could be overshooting itself, obviously, there have been some deals announced recently, where aircraft -- fleets of aircraft have been acquired that are going to go to freighter. But I think at this point, it’s still pretty strong. But there is a lot of interest there and that very quickly can get frothy?
Josh Sullivan:
Got it. And then I guess just switching over to some of the digital offerings you guys had put together before COVID hit. Has the disruption helped with adoption of those products, opened up any opportunities for you guys?
John Holmes:
That’s a great question. We continue to see, albeit at a depressed level, traffic through our digital channels. There are a number of initiatives that we had begun pre-COVID. We paused a couple of those, but we have restarted them to bring new digital services to market and have really used this time to reflect on what we think will be successful going forward. I am encouraged by the continued interest from our customers in all sorts of digital solutions and we are fortunate to be in a position where we have got the capital to continue to make the investments. But digital and the development around it remains a core part of the strategy.
Josh Sullivan:
Got it. Thank you.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
And thank you. And we have a follow-up question from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Joseph DeNardi:
Yeah. Thanks. John, just along the lines of how many additional airlines could maybe use your value-oriented services on the other side of it that maybe didn’t needed before this, is there any way to quantify that, like, maybe just in the U.S. How many airlines took advantage of that, maybe how many airlines didn’t need to because of their financial strength and that may be different six months from now? Thanks.
John Holmes:
Yeah. Sure. In the U.S., there are still a number of large carriers, both -- yeah, number of large carriers where we do a little bit of business with, but we see a lot of opportunity. For example, we could have one major airline where we feel we have done a great job penetrating the account and we are doing over $100 million. We have another airline with a very similar fleet, where we do less than $10 million. And so I do see a reasonable amount of opportunity here in the U.S., both with, call it, the major carriers as well as the lower-cost carriers. By market, Asia, we have had a great run in Asia over the last several years, but still there is an enormous amount of opportunity with the larger Asian carriers as they look to adopt non-OEM solutions and look for aftermarket solutions like ours. And that’s some of the real bright spot we have seen in the last several months have been, in particular, inquiries from our Asian customers where we might do a little bit of business, but how can we do more, how can we do more together, and it’s early days, but those conversations wouldn’t have happened -- were not happening a year ago, so that’s encouraging. And also, beyond Asia, I would also put the Middle East in that category as well, inasmuch as historically those operators have been very focused on OEM-based solutions. And while we haven’t had kind of dialog yet that we had with some of our Asian customers, I would expect and hope that we would see more opportunity coming out of the Middle East for us.
Joseph DeNardi:
That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. And I am showing no further questions.
John Holmes:
All right, everybody. We really appreciate your time and your interest. Thank you.

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2020 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in the company's news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019, and Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended February 29, 2020. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. I really appreciate you joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and our full year 2020 results. Before we get into those results, I'd like to begin by thanking the AAR team for its truly remarkable strength during these unprecedented times. In many cases, we have had to make difficult decisions in order to align our costs with a lower demand environment. And I'm really proud of my teammates for their professionalism and resilience, as we work through the impact of COVID-19. I also want to thank our customers for their unwavering support and for recognizing the unique value that AAR continues to bring. In addition, I'd like to comment on diversity and inclusion. These imperatives have been part of AAR's core values for decades. We have a long history, both internally and within our communities, of supporting and promoting underrepresented groups. However, the events in recent months have prompted us to broaden our efforts to try to understand systemic racism and discrimination and determine how we can continue to improve as a company and as a society. To that end, we are taking several additional steps that will enable us to rebuild our workforce with an even more diverse team, as our industry recovers. Much as AAR has played an industry-leading role in addressing the shortage of skilled labor, so too can we play a role -- a leadership role in building a more diverse and inclusive aviation workforce at all levels in the industry. With that, I want to turn to our results. As you all know, the commercial aviation industry has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of the challenging environment, I'm very pleased with our overall performance. Our sales for the year grew 1% from $2.05 billion to $2.07 billion. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share, from continuing operations, decreased 12% from $2.44 per share to $2.15 per share. Although, our earnings for the year were down from 2019 levels, our results reflect three quarters of record sales and earnings performance and the fourth quarter in which we were able to effectively navigate a historic decline in the commercial aviation industry, due to the unprecedented grounding of the world's fleet. Sales for the fourth quarter were down 26%, from $563 million to $417 million. And adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were down 62% from $0.68 per share to $0.26 per share. We took numerous cost reduction actions early in the quarter to offset the impact, which we described in our May 21 8-K, including facility closures and consolidations, exiting unprofitable product lines and exiting or restructuring underperforming commercial programs contracts. These resulted in a pre-tax charge in the quarter of $27.9 million and bringing our cost structure into much better alignment with the current revenue base. In addition, our agreement to divest our Composites Manufacturing operation, which we announced a few weeks ago, was not profitable in FY 2020 and is not core to our Aviation Services offering as a step towards further enhancing our profitability. We had launched the sale process earlier this calendar year and are pleased to have agreed on a transaction that furthers our multi-year strategy to focus on our industry-leading Aviation Services and reduce complexity in our operations. All of these actions, along with the actions we are continuing to take in the current quarter, produced permanent changes in our cost structure, which we expect to improve margins as our revenue recovers. Even in this environment, we continue to pursue and win new business and I want to highlight a few examples. During the quarter we announced an agreement with BASF to distribute and maintain certain aircraft cabin air quality improvement products, as well as $125 million sole source contract with the U.S. Air Force to produce and repair 463L cargo pallets. We also announced a joint venture with Sumitomo to provide supply chain solutions to the Japanese defense market and to distribute parts from Japanese OEMs to the global aftermarket. In addition subsequent to the quarter, we announced an extension and meaningful expansion of our agreement with Unison Industries, a subsidiary of GE Aviation. In this agreement we serve as its exclusive worldwide aftermarket distributor for aviation, military, civil and land vehicle products. The agreement also includes repair services and is valued at more than $1 billion over 11 years. This award demonstrates the value of AAR's distribution model and connected businesses strategy, as well as our ability to use our relative strength to extend and grow our business during the pandemic. Before turning it over to Sean, I also want to touch on the expected agreement we announced yesterday with the U.S. Treasury under the Air Carrier Worker Support portion of the CARES Act. Under that agreement, we expect to receive $57.2 million to pay salaries, wages and benefits to the workforce currently employed in our U.S. airframe landing gear MRO operations. Of the $57.2 million, $48.5 million is a grant and $8.7 million is a low interest prepayable note. As you know, over the last two years we have worked to successfully build a technical workforce for AAR and we have launched initiatives to bring new talent into our industry. This grant helps ensure that those efforts will continue and I really want to thank Congress and in particular the Illinois, Oklahoma, Indiana -- and Indiana delegations, as well as the administration for recognizing the essential services that our employees provide to the commercial aviation industry. With that I'll turn it over to our CFO, Sean Gillen.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks John. Our sales in the quarter of $416.5 million were down 26% or $146.2 million year-over-year including a $7.5 million impact related to the exit of certain contracts. Sales to government and defense customers were 47% of consolidated sales versus 35% in the prior year quarter as our commercial activities were significantly impacted by COVID-19. Specifically, our commercial sales were down 40% year-over-year. As John mentioned, we took a number of steps in the quarter to reduce our fixed cost and overhead including closing our Goldboro and Duluth facilities and exiting or restructuring underperforming contracts and product lines, primarily in our commercial programs business. These actions resulted in a predominantly non-cash charge of $27.9 million which is recorded in the P&L a reduction in revenue of $7.5 million, an increase in the cost of sales of $15.7 million, an increase in SG&A of $2.8 million and a loss from joint ventures of $1.9 million. We are continuing to take additional actions in Q1 to reduce costs and improve margins. These include the Composites divestiture, as well as continuing to address underperforming programs and additional footprint rationalization. We estimate that all of our actions will reduce our SG&A by over $50 million on an annualized basis. And we will remain disciplined about maintaining these cost savings enabling margin expansion as demand recovers. Gross profit margin in the quarter was 8.7% versus 16.8% in the prior year quarter. Excluding the charges gross profit margin was 14.1% versus 17.0% in the prior year period which reflects $0.9 million of adjustments in the prior year period related to facility repositioning costs. Aviation Services gross profit decreased $53.2 million. Our government business across parts, repair and integrated solutions remained relatively stable and we were able to emphasize our cargo end markets. However demand in our commercial airline businesses was down as a result of the pandemic including in both parts and maintenance services. Within our heavy maintenance business although we began the quarter with full hangers, work slowed throughout the quarter and remained at reduced levels which we expect to continue during our seasonally low Q1. In Expeditionary Services, gross profit decreased $5.1 million. We expect performance in this segment will improve as Mobility executes on the Air Force pallet contract and we complete the divestiture of Composites. SG&A expenses were $47.3 million for the quarter. Adjusted SG&A was $46.5 million down $10.8 million from the prior year quarter. This reduction was primarily driven by the COVID-19 related overhead cost actions we took. During the quarter, we elected to draw the remaining available balance under our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure which resulted in net interest expense increasing $0.5 million to $2.6 million. We expect to repay the facility this quarter such that we maintain cash on hand going forward consistent with historical levels. In the quarter we used $18.6 million of cash in our operating activities from continuing operations, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable, contract assets and inventory. Also during the quarter, we returned $2.6 million to shareholders via a dividend of $0.075 per share. As a condition of accepting payroll funding from the U.S. Treasury under the CARES Act, we are not permitted to pay additional dividends through September 30 of 2021. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt of $197.3 million and net leverage of 1.3 turns. We have no near-term maturities. And as of the end of the quarter, we had unrestricted cash of $404.7 million. With respect to the CARES Act funding, we expect to receive the funds during our fiscal first quarter. Upon receipt, we will record an increase to unrestricted cash and corresponding liabilities for labor cost pursuant to the grant portion and for the unsecured note. The benefit will flow through the P&L. Specifically, as we incur salary wages and benefit costs in our U.S. airframe and landing gear operations, we will offset the expense on the income statement until the funds are depleted, which is expected to take approximately two to three quarters. Similar to other government workforce subsidies, we will exclude the income from our adjusted earnings. Acceptance of the fund does not undo any of the cost actions taken in the fourth quarter. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased with our Q4 and full year results and I'm proud of the courage and dedication of our employees. Our government business continues to be healthy and growing and we are having success placing more emphasis on our cargo end markets. When the environment continues to be very dynamic, our commercial airline businesses have performed better than expected, as a result of the early cost actions that we took in the quarter, as well as our deep customer relationships. In addition, our liquidity and balance sheet remained strong, which we view as a competitive advantage, allowing us to secure new business. Our Unison win is a great example of this. However, we remain very focused on generating cash to preserve and enhance our liquidity position. We expect to continue to make structural changes to our portfolio, which, when combined with the actions we have already taken, will improve the margins of the company as we recover. That said, the duration of the crisis remains very uncertain. And for that reason, we are not providing guidance for FY 2021. We do expect sales in Q1, which is typically our lowest quarter based on seasonality, to be down sequentially from Q4, consistent with prior years. Overall, we are confident in our ability to navigate the current environment and we believe we have an opportunity to use our relative strength to emerge from the crisis even stronger, more profitable and better positioned for long-term growth. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
Hey. Good afternoon, John and Sean. Understanding this is a dynamic time, yes, and obviously very difficult, one of the things, I think, would be helpful for investors is to see if we can figure out where trough is. And so, in the context of your 40% decline in commercial, how do we think about the months in the quarter? And then, you talked about this, sort of, seasonality on a sequential basis, but have you troughed? And can we talk about that separately for MRO versus parts?
John Holmes:
Yes. Sure. Good question. So from a parts standpoint, we felt the decline very early in the quarter. And I think the levels that we're at now, which are again better than what we expected have been holding the last several weeks. And given the dynamic and the environment, it's difficult to call anything a trough. But we saw a decline and they have been holding steady for the last several weeks. Now, obviously, there's a lot of movement out there, particularly with the North American carriers, in terms of the results of the recent surge and changes they may be making to their fleets. But so far the last several weeks, the parts businesses, both distribution and trading have held in there. For MRO, throughout the quarter, we started the quarter with full hangers. And then, throughout the quarter we delivered aircraft. In many cases, those aircraft were not replaced by an additional aircraft. So we did see decline through the quarter. We are at a depressed level, heading into the summer from where we would normally be. But, seasonally, it's typically a low quarter for us. As it relates to MRO, we have a lot of dialogue with the customers right now about what the fall is going to look like. And I would say that's a very dynamic discussion. We're not yet clear on what the fall maintenance schedule will be. But we're confident that the customers are focused on keeping our facilities as full as possible because they want to make sure that they're available to them as they see a recovery.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then – thank you for that. I'd like to dig in a little bit in terms of how the customers are thinking about this. One of the ways that we look at it is the size of the parked fleet. So I guess the parked fleet got up to about 16000, 17000 aircraft early on in this thing and now has dipped below 10,000, so that's good news. Has that translated into more business, or are those aircraft that are coming back in not in need of maintenance?
John Holmes:
We haven't seen it translate yet, but we do expect that there is a backlog of maintenance requirements that's building out there. And as the airlines look to manage their cash, we expect those maintenance events to convert. We do view that though with respect to potential retirements and the introduction of new aircraft into the fleet. And I think those dynamics are still playing out.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then this one other thing I wanted to ask you about was part outs and what if anything is happening there.
John Holmes:
Yes. So haven't seen a tremendous amount of activity there and certainly that's something we're looking at closely. If you think about the growth in our trading business in particular over the last several years, the constraint really to growth has been -- and we did grow, but the constraint to further growth has been availability of material. So we are looking forward to opportunities to part out aircraft and bring in more material to the market and capture a greater percentage there. The other thing that we expect to see as we go through this and our sales force is working very hard on this is airlines that may not have been historical users use serviceable material, given the pressure on cost, we may see more conversions of customers that typically have been OEM buyers look for alternative sources like USM. So as more material comes on the market, as well as we can convert more customers take advantage of the cost savings that come with buying USM, we expect to see growth in recovery there.
Robert Spingarn:
And on that point on material coming to the market you just said that the supply material is an important driver. Is that just not happening yet because those who own the aircraft aren't yet sure what they want to do with them?
John Holmes:
Yes I think that's a fair assessment. And just because aircraft are parked to retire does not necessarily mean they're going to go straight to part out. That takes time. And there is only a certain amount of available capacity out there in the market to part out aircraft. So there's a lot of factors at play in terms of how that new material or how that used material hits the market.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Thank you very much. I will step out.
Operator:
Thanks. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Joseph DeNardi:
Hey good afternoon. John, just maybe along the lines of Rob's question, can you just maybe level set where things are now? Like what was the commercial business down in June or kind of where is it running now?
John Holmes:
Yes. I don't know that we want to necessarily comment on individual months, but we saw -- throughout the quarter we saw a 40% decline in total and certainly that's accelerated between March and May. But the levels that we are seeing in June are slight -- or saw in June and are seeing in July are slightly better than what we saw in April and May but still at a depressed level. So we're holding at the current position for the time being.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. Okay. And then maybe just kind of some more clarity around kind of the nature of your conversations with some of the airlines, I would imagine that some of them are obviously now under greater financial pressure would be more interested in shifting risk and capital onto your balance sheet and taking advantage of that. Has that -- is that starting to present itself as an opportunity or not yet? And do you see that eventually as becoming one?
John Holmes:
Definitely see that, potentially coming out from the airline. We actually already are seeing it from the OEMs. So in the distribution business, there's been a lot of discussions with OEMs at all levels in the supply chain of looking to your point to take advantage of our relative strength in exchange for long-term distribution agreements. We are exceptionally focused on our liquidity position and our cash position. So we're considering those deals very carefully. But we do view that as an opportunity to add strength to the distribution business, which has been a great success story for the last few years.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. And then maybe along the lines of the MRO business coming back are you getting any kind of unusual requests from airlines in terms of how that work is financed? Are they asking you to extend them unusual terms given their liquidity relative to yours?
John Holmes:
We went through a – we went through a number of those discussions several months ago early in the quarter in terms of looking at extended terms for our airline customers. And that was pretty much. I wouldn't call that necessarily unusual. It was pretty much a universal request from all of our partners out there. And we – in turn we flowed that down to our supply base as well. So we have extended terms to our customers, and we've received extended terms from our supply base. And beyond that, we haven't seen any request that, I would consider unusual.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of SunTrust. Your question, please.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey, good evening, guys. John, Sean, thanks for taking the questions here. I know – maybe I'm not sure, if this is John or Sean. I know you guys aren't going to give any specific revenue guidance for the year. But I think you talked about taking $50 million of SG&A out of the business probably implies $170 million. Is it fair to say, you're sizing the business for maybe a $1.6 billion revenue run rate just thinking about kind of how you've been running at SG&A? Is that a fair bogey to think about?
John Holmes:
I wouldn't think about the SG&A target necessarily in the context of revenue sizing. I would think about the SG&A target in – really around improving our margins. As you can tell, we're taking a lot of action during this period of time and we're taking quick actions to really change the structure of our cost base as Sean mentioned in many cases on a permanent basis going forward. We've had a number of margin improvement targets for a long time and we're really using this time to accelerate our efforts in that regard. I don't know, Sean if you want to –
Sean Gillen:
Yeah. I would just add Mike, my comment was over $50 million and it's across ISG&A so indirect spend, as well as SG&A, just wanted to clarify that.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Got it. And then can you just talk about – you kind of talked about some of the conversations with the airlines. But can you maybe talk to some of the integrated program the power-by-the-hour contracts? I mean, it seems like we're going to be an environment here of reduced flying hours for quite some time. I think – United just said they expect 65% capacity through this third quarter here. What are the implications on those existing contracts you have with your broad airline customers?
John Holmes:
Yeah. So we also are prepared for an extended period of depressed flying. And that's the way we're modeling the business in the way we're sizing the business. As it relates to commercial programs in particular that's a business that you did see significant decline in that business right away, because just by definition you build based on flight hours and many of those customers had grounded all – nearly all of their fleet during the period of time. As Sean mentioned, we did take some charges in that area, because those contracts to the extent that they – they are flexible enough to work in this environment, we leave them in place. To the extent that, the contract will not match the customers' operation and our requirements going forward, we're looking to restructure, and stay with that customer. But in some cases, we've chosen to exit an agreement. And as we've talked about for the last couple of quarters that business even before COVID had been under pressure due to market dynamics and changes in costs in the supply chain. And once again we're taking this opportunity to restructure that business so that when we come out of it, it's much more profitable going forward.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then I got one more here and then I'll jump back in the queue. Inventory levels were up. If I think about -- just the total lack of flying if someone like United's capacity is going to be down 65%. How do you think about burning down inventory if there's just a complete lack of flying hours, a lack of pull on any inventory in the broader supply chain if distributors are fully stocked? I mean does this become a little bit problematic to move inventory if there's just not a lot of consumption out there? I mean, how are you guys thinking about maybe converting that inventory into cash -- under this depressed environment?
John Holmes:
No great question. And converting inventory to cash is a very tough priority for us. You saw the inventory come up because pre-COVID there were a number of agreements that were signed that had investment requirements. And we in almost all cases lived up to those commitments to our partners particularly in the distribution business. So that drove a lot of the inventory increase. We feel good about the position that we have. We feel good about the parts that we carry. The parts in particular in the commercial programs business those are by definition for those parts, the higher moving, higher consumed parts just the way those contracts work. So it is material in a normal environment that would be high demand. But as you point out we are not in a normal environment. So we are redoubling our efforts to market that material very effectively get creative in terms of the trading material that we have against other services that may be required from the customer base and looking to move it as best we can. But there's still as we keep saying a great deal of uncertainty out there in terms of how the overall fleet will unfold. And we may see certain asset classes where we would have expected a shorter life to actually get extended because new aircraft deliveries aren't going to occur. So we're watching that as well. And I do want to mention the point that I made to Rob Spingarn's question just around another effort we have underway is to convert customers to USM. This is a great time to -- when there's material available particularly on our shelves within the market to really tap the benefits of buying used material that is often available at 30%, 60%, 70% of lift to customers that actually do have demand.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it.
John Holmes:
And just one more point on that. We are seeing -- if we look across different markets, we have seen a meaningful uptick in Asia. We are starting just in the last few weeks to see more activity out of Europe. Certainly, you've seen major changes here in North America. But that's another avenue is to go where the action is. And right now we're redoubling our efforts in the market that are further ahead on the recovery as we look to move that material.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. And any pricing pressure on that material John -- either on your existing parts trading or just presumably a flood of parts out there where you kind of said you're getting creative and doing different things to market that material? Is pricing eroding in the marketplace?
John Holmes:
We've definitely seen pricing at the whole aircraft level decline and we've seen some trades out there at meaningful discounts from where we saw pre-COVID. Certain higher dollar LRUs we've seen a bit of that but -- and we expect to see that. But nothing -- no kind of macro statistics I could give you at this point in terms of values at the part level.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Thanks, guys. I will jump back in the queue.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan of Benchmark. Your line is open.
Josh Sullivan:
Hey, good afternoon, John and Sean.
John Holmes:
Hi, Josh.
Josh Sullivan:
On the cargo business how sustainable is the current strength? Maybe if you could just talk about what the pipeline or lead times look like for cargo conversions?
John Holmes:
Yes. I mean there's 00 obviously there's a lot of action out there in that market. And you certainly have the traditional cargo carriers and we talk about our focus on it. We've got sales resources that previously had been covering dozens of commercial passenger accounts. Obviously, in many cases their account base has shrunk or is just not as active as it was before. And we're redeploying those resources to focus on the cargo markets. And that's just not -- that's not parts, that's also heavy maintenance as well. We actually saw our first 747 cargo aircraft in our Miami maintenance facility. It's the first time done work on 747 in a really long time in that facility. And we just completed one and shipped it off and we're looking to do more with that particular customer. So it's an area of focus and, I think, opportunity for us, again, not just on the maintenance side, but also on the parts side as well.
Joshua Sullivan:
And then, just how is the conversation going with the airlines on their long-term MRO needs? I mean, at one point pre-COVID, market was very tight for labor, both for you and the airlines internally. But as far as the MRO outsourcing model, as the airlines restructure, you're having those longer-term conversations about maybe what outsourcing can bring to them?
John Holmes:
Yes. Yes. I would say that, that is a very dynamic environment and definitely tracks with what you see out there, in terms of their maintenance requirements are going to be aligned with the flying that they expect to do. And so, certainly, no one's talking about bringing -- at least to my knowledge that we're talking to, no one's talking about bringing work in-house. Everybody is committed to the outsource model. And there is a real interest and focus on the part of our customer base of making sure that top-tier providers like AAR are around to service the aircraft when demand recovers. That expectation, I would say, given recent events here in the U.S., has pushed out to the right versus where I think people were thinking it was going to be a month or six weeks ago. But everybody expects a recovery. Different customers have different expectations of the time line of that recovery and they all recognize though that they're going to need an outsourced maintenance provider. And keeping our facilities full and running as best they can, to make sure that we retain the workforce, so that it's ready when they start to need maintenance at a greater scale, is also a major focus of theirs.
Joshua Sullivan:
Got it. And then, just one last one, following up on one of Rob's questions, on part outs. Just with regard to your relationship with -- I believe, its Napier Park, are you anticipating the material use of that joint venture as those parts material become available? And then how large do you think that could potentially get?
John Holmes:
That is a great question. We are very excited about the partnership that we have with Napier. We've deployed only a fraction of that capital to date. And so there's a great deal of dry powder to go out and look for opportunities. That said, there's still so much moving in the market, it's difficult at this moment to tell what a good deal really is. And so, we're paying very close attention to it. But we're also mindful that, what we see today may look a lot different in a month. And we're approaching that market for acquisitions that ultimately could go to tear down or short-term lease very cautiously.
Joshua Sullivan:
Got it. Thank you.
John Holmes:
Thanks.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert of Canaccord. Your question please.
Ken Herbert:
Hey, John and Sean. Good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hi, Ken.
Ken Herbert:
Hey, John, I wanted to ask, if sitting here today, as you look at your fiscal second and third quarters for the MRO business, can you provide any quantification or commentary on how your backlog for MRO looks this year, maybe just relative to prior years, specifically for the second and the third fiscal quarters?
John Holmes:
Yes. The backlog is less than it was, call it, a year ago. We're -- again, not to repeat, but we're encouraged by the dialogue that we're having from our customers in as much as there's going to be less work to go around. But they want to make sure that their top-tier providers, like AAR, get the work, so that we can keep our operations running. We have both, through -- obviously, we closed our facility in Duluth and we have shrunk our footprint utilization at certain other facilities and unfortunately had to reduce our workforce. We have sized our MRO operation for a much smaller labor utilization going into this fiscal year than we would have had last fiscal year. And so, against that smaller footprint as a percentage we're actually sold out approximately the same percentage that we would in a normal year. It's just on a much lower base.
Ken Herbert:
Got it. And if my calculations are correct it looks like from -- with the facility closures from a man-hour basis, you've maybe taken your capacity down by somewhere in the 10% to 20% range?
John Holmes:
Yes closer to the higher end of that range. Yes.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. Okay. Very helpful. And can you just remind us the split of your capabilities in MRO between wide-body and narrow-body? You mentioned the 47 down at your Miami facility. And are you seeing any opportunity yet to maybe take share from cargo carriers that historically have sent the wide-body aircraft for MRO over to Asian or other lower cost markets?
John Holmes:
That is the dialogue we're having. We -- there are certain of our facilities -- our facility in Rockford facility in Miami for example that are wide-body facilities. And we have had interest and we have that interest in repatriating that work. That's been a dialogue that's out there for a long time. But there are definitely given the current environment I'd say, renewed interest of bringing that some of that work back. So no particular deals in place there yet, but it is a conversation that we're having. The one -- just to go back to your previous question one point I would want to make. Our capacity in the MRO business is really -- is driven by the amount of labor available to it not necessarily our footprint. So even though we've reduced our footprint to the extent that we have demand and are able to secure labor to support that demand, we could actually see the same level of production off of this reduced footprint as we saw pre-COVID. And as Sean said a number of the changes that we make like rationalizing our footprint position us to be more profitable coming out of this once we see demand return.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. That's helpful. And if you look John relative to -- I know this time is obviously very different. But as you look at the downturn now there's a lot of speculation that as demand from the airlines for MRO and parts and services does start to come back, there will be significant green time availability, primarily on engines and other more capital-intensive assets. How much of a lag do you expect that to be or to create in the recovery? Is it a matter of weeks? Could it be a matter of quarters? I mean how are you thinking about that as you think about MRO and parts trading in other parts of your business?
John Holmes:
Yes. I would think about it at most a matter of quarters. But a lot of the airlines have -- they've already started to burn that green time right? I mean they're moving engines from all of them at least our customers went very quickly into a cash conservation mode. And so rather than sending engines to overhaul they're swapping engines out on parked aircraft etcetera to the extent that there's removable LRUs that they can cannibalize. So that's already occurring. In some ways we think that the opposite is there -- is actually a very significant amount of deferred maintenance that's building out there, so that when we see a return to flying you might actually see a much quicker and more dramatic uptick in parts requirements and maintenance requirements because that green time is being burned as we speak.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, very helpful. Just one final question. Congratulations on the Unison renewal there. As I look at your distribution business both on the military and the commercial side with the new contracts you've added in over the last couple of quarters and renewals like this and potential for -- obviously you talked about new potential OEM relationships in this climate. Can that business in fiscal 2021 be flat relative to fiscal 2020, or can you just give any more sort of color around expectations for that business?
John Holmes:
We expect the government half of that business to be up in fiscal 2020. Even with the new additions depending on the timing I would still say the commercial portion of that business even with new wins there would likely not be enough net new revenue to get the commercial business flat – you know have it. Yeah.
Ken Herbert:
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. All right. Well, thank you very much. I will pass it back.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is open.
Joseph DeNardi:
Yeah. John just along the lines of the prior question. If it takes airlines until 2023 to get back to pre-COVID levels of flying and revenue perhaps, do you get back there before them like the same time or after?
John Holmes:
I think it depends on how ultimately the fleet shakes out. So to the extent that, you have more retirements in fleets that see more new aircraft deliveries and more retirements we lag. To the extent that you see, airlines recover and either defer or cancel new aircraft deliveries and they've built up as I said before a pretty deferred a pretty significant amount of deferred maintenance, you could see an increase well before.
Joseph DeNardi:
Got it. And then when you look at that – when you look across your exposure to aircraft type kind of across the business obviously there are aircraft types being exited in the U.S. pretty quickly. When you look at what's being retired are there any surprises? And do inventory levels on the balance sheet reflect some of those risks currently?
John Holmes:
Yeah. First of all, no surprises. As a matter of fact, we think one the larger ones American was – that was announced many months ago and that was expanded a little bit but that was kind of already out there. So no surprises and certainly, whether it's the 747 you've seen a lot more retirements obviously in the wide-body 777s et cetera, that's less significant to us. So not as – not as concerned about that. And you've got MD-80 or MD-80, MD-90 that have retired again no surprises there. So I think, so far we're not seeing – what we're seeing is tracking with what we would expect. And again, we're very eager based on the – particularly, the engine support contracts we have with certain shops to get our hands on material that previously prior to COVID would not have been available to us, so we can support demand. And albeit, the overall demand will be depressed, but we expect to be able to support a greater percentage of that demand as things recur.
Joseph DeNardi:
Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
Hey. Just a follow-up to Joe's question there on the – when I look at the $600-plus million in inventories on the books here, what you're saying John is not a rather insignificant piece of that would be the red programs. When I say red I'm talking about some of the programs you just mentioned. So, anything with four engines and MD-80s 90s and 757?
John Holmes:
Yeah, it's correct. The wide-body exposure is very limited and we actually in the quarter, we wrote down our positions on the MD-80, 90 we wrote those positions off. There was some ATR material that we wrote off as well. So anything truly red, we've already taken action on.
Robert Spingarn:
Just curious what do you think of something like the 777s that came out of Delta that are 10 years old? I mean, what's going to happen to airplanes like that? I understand in that specific case they own them they'll have to release them. But is there going to be a market for something like that at least on a part out basis?
John Holmes:
Yeah. I mean, there could be. I think about, I don't know five or six years ago, when the 767 was dead and we couldn't give away ADC material. And then all of a sudden Amazon started flying and it became one of the hottest asset types around. There's no question. I mean, that's a great aircraft and it's hard to predict where they might find a home, but we certainly would – yes, yes, like it's hard to predict whether it'll find a home but we certainly would expect use for an aircraft of that type.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then Sean, I have one for you and it touches on some of the things that have already been discussed. But in looking at the cash flow in the quarter, some of the working capital accounts moved differently than I might have expected specifically receivables and payables. And then more – the other thing, I wanted to ask you about is, how do we think about breakeven operating cash flow. What level of revenue supports a breakeven operating cash flow?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. On the first part in terms of the balance sheet and net working capital items in the quarter, accounts receivable given the decline in the topline, we were able to work that down pretty significantly and have it be a big provider of cash. So, I'd say some of that was in line with just activity declining in that kind of new AAR being put in they were able to work down in the quarter. And then on accounts payable, I'd say in a similar way there was a lot less new purchasing activity because we tried to really focus on cash flow generation. So, this was taking things that weren't aged, but the payables were coming due and managing them at the end of the fiscal year. So, that's the two biggest. And then on contract assets as the activity in the hangers come down that kind of comes down in line with some of those activity, which is a net provider of cash because of that dynamic. In terms of kind of where does the topline need to be in terms of breakeven, for us, we're kind of not giving guidance on that, but when we think about where the balance sheet is and the amount of inventory we have and focus on turning the inventory into cash, I'd say there's not a kind of bright line of where sales for the whole company needs to be as long as we can kind of continue to focus on inventory and limit new buys. Caveat being that as we take advantage of our relative position of strength for things like Unison and other items that come up, we're going to want to put some capital to work on new positions to expand our market share in this period of time.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. All right. Thanks very much Sean.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of SunTrust. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Sean just to look -- I know you're not giving guidance again. But how are you guys thinking about the level of adjustments or charges on a go-forward basis? Anything that we should expect in the coming quarters, whether it's the ongoing facility, severance? Obviously hard to predict the customer contract and customer bankruptcies, but just trying to get a sense of what we should expect here in terms of any non-operational or non-repeatable charges.
Sean Gillen:
Yes. Good question and we'll kind of stay away from forecasting or guiding on that. But there are activities that continue to take place in Q1. One Composites we included it in the 8-K. I mentioned previously that that would be about $20 million charge associated with the divestiture of that business. And I would expect there's other kind of activities whether it be headcount or facility. And then we're reviewing the portfolio on some of these contracts, but I can't say today what that would look like.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay.
John Holmes:
Sorry I would just add that we're very focused on any action that we take it results in a one-time event that that action is going to have a meaningful improvement on the profitability of the company going forward.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Should we think about sequentially -- obviously, a tough environment, but given some of the cost actions, do gross margins improve sequentially? I mean it's going to be a lower volume quarter, but how should we think about maybe the gross margin profile here?
John Holmes:
I would say that over time it will improve, but I would not expect sequential improvement. And again the reason we're not giving guidance is because we are in such a dynamic environment right now.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Yes, truly understand. Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator:
Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
John Holmes:
Great. Well thank you. Thank you everybody for the time and interest today. We really appreciate it and we hope everyone stays safe out there. And we look forward to talking about our Q1 results in 90 days. Thank you.
Operator:

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR’s Fiscal 2020 Third Quarter Earnings Call. We’re joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in the company’s news release and the Risk Factors sections of the company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019 and Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended February 29, 2020. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR’s President and CEO, John Holmes. You may begin.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. I really appreciate you all joining us today to discuss our Q3 FY 2020 results. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I’d like to make some comments regarding COVID-19. First, our thoughts are with all of those who have been directly impacted, and our appreciation goes out to the healthcare workers around the world who are fighting the front lines on this. As you know, this is an unprecedented situation for the global aviation industry. AAR enters this uncertain period from a position of strength. We have a diverse business mix with approximately 35% of sales from government customers and meaningful commercial sales to cargo carriers. We also have a strong balance sheet with less than one-times net leverage, significant liquidity and strong customer relationships. That said, we expect a sizeable impact to our commercial airline business as a result of the decrease in commercial air traffic. In order to proactively address the anticipated impact of COVID-19, we are taking steps to ensure that costs remain aligned with the decreasing demand. These steps include a hiring freeze, reducing or eliminating all non-essential spend, reducing executive compensation, furloughs and, unfortunately, reductions in our workforce. That said, we remain prepared to take additional action as warranted to respond to the evolving business environment. With respect to potential government assistance, I have been in direct contact with members of both the House and the Senate, as well as the Administration regarding potential support, not just for the airlines, but also for the broader aviation industry. As you know, we have worked diligently over the last several quarters to enhance our recruiting efforts, develop training programs and partnering with various schools to create a pipeline for technicians. Given our focus and success in building and retaining a skilled workforce, we are particularly supportive of all government measures aimed at preserving jobs. The safety and health of our people, as well as our customers and vendors is a top priority. We’re closely following CDC guidelines and have enacted remote working, social distancing, and related business continuity plans across all of our offices and facilities. These measures, combined with the overall business climate, create a great deal of uncertainty and stress for our people. And I really want to take this opportunity to thank the employees at AAR for their hard work, dedication and flexibility as we go through this difficult time. I’m very proud to be part of the best team in aviation. Turning to our results. We had a record third quarter and I’m pleased with the overall performance. Sales were 4% from $530 million to $553 million and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from $0.62 per share to $0.67 per share. These strong results were driven by continued exceptional performance from our government programs, parts supply and MRO activities. In the quarter, we announced several new business wins, which demonstrate that AAR continues to be the partner of choice in the aviation services industry. Specifically, we announced that – we announced plans to expand our airframe maintenance services with Air Canada to cover its A330 fleet. Additionally, AeroControlex, the large manufacturer of critical components to the aviation industry, selected AAR to be its exclusive global distributor for the APU lube pump product line. We have strong aftermarket expertise in these particular products and are already seeing results from the significant growth opportunity. Finally, we secured a $90 million sole-source IDIQ contract with the Defense Logistics Agency for specialized shipping and storage containers as well as accessories. As described in the release, there are several restructuring actions that we have taken and will take to continue to improve the performance and strength of AAR. As we have previously discussed, we have seen increased costs in certain commercial programs contracts, which were adversely impacting our financial results. We have taken decisive action to exit one contract and restructure two others, which will allow us to free up capital, improve cash flow and increase margins. These actions resulted in a one-time predominantly non-cash charge of $24.7 million. We’ve also made the decision to pursue several additional restructuring actions in our fiscal Q4, which involve consolidating facilities to further reduce costs. Before turning over to Sean, I’m pleased to share that subsequent to the quarter-end, we completed the sale of our final contract within the COCO Airlift business. As previously discussed, this completes the exit of that business as part of our strategic shift, and we are pleased to have that element of our plan complete. With that, I’ll turn it over to Sean, our CFO.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $553.1 million were up 4.5%, or $23.6 million year-over-year. This included a $33 million, or 6.6% increase in Aviation Services revenues, primarily driven by execution on government contracts, which represent approximately 35% of our revenue. Improvement in MRO volumes and strong demand in our parts supply activities also contributed to the increase. As John mentioned, in our commercial programs business, we terminated one contract and restructured two other contracts during the quarter. These actions resulted in a one-time predominantly non-cash charge of $24.7 million, which shows up in the P&L as a reduction in revenue of $9.8 million and the establishment of forward loss reserves and other related charges in cost of sales of $14.9 million. Aviation Services gross profit decreased $16.5 million, which was driven by the one-time $24.7 million charge. Excluding this charge, our profit would have increased by $8 million. Each of government programs MRO and parts supplies gross profit increased year-over-year. Gross profit within Expeditionary Services decreased $3.5 million. While we had expected a recovery in this segment this quarter, we continue to experience a delay in a large contract award and certain operational challenges. We are taking restructuring actions in Q4 to reduce fixed costs and overhead. Within our Expeditionary Services, we will consolidate facilities, which will improve production efficiencies, eliminate excess capacity and significantly decrease our overhead and fixed costs. We expect these restructuring actions, along with our current backlog, to result in improved performance going forward. Additionally, as John discussed, in the fourth quarter, we have initiated cost reduction actions in light of COVID-19, which included a hiring freeze, reducing or eliminating all non-essential spend, reducing executive compensation, furloughs, and reductions in force. In total, we expect the facilities consolidation and COVID-19-related steps to result in one-time costs of approximately $15 million to $20 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter, with the payback on these actions realized within one year. In the quarter, SG&A expenses were 10.5% of sales versus 10.3% in the prior period, with the increase largely driven by investigation and compliance-related costs. Excluding investigation and severance costs from both periods, SG&A would have been 9.9% of sales in the current quarter, compared to 10.1% in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $2.3 million, compared to $2.4 million last year, due to lower borrowings in the current year, partially offset by higher rates. During the quarter, our cash flow provided from operating activities from continuing operations was $9.7 million. We continue to invest in inventory to support our parts supply activities. Additionally, as we performed under a certain government program contract that paid in advance last year, we significantly reduced our deferred revenue on the program, which resulted in less cash flows in the prior year period. During the quarter, we returned $2.6 million to shareholders via a dividend of $0.075 per share. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt at $171.1 million and net leverage of 0.9 times. Earlier this year, we upsized our revolver by $100 million to $600 million and extended the maturity to September 2024. Our only other maturity is a $23 million term loan due November 2021. As of the end of the quarter, we had total liquidity of $432 million, which included unrestricted cash of $37 million and revolver availability of $395 million. In addition, we had net capacity available under our accounts receivable facility of $92 million. Thank you for your attention. And I’ll now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. While we are pleased with our Q3 and year-to-date results, which have tracked ahead of our previously raised guidance, due to the effects of COVID-19 on the commercial airline market, we believe it is prudent to withdraw our fiscal year 2020 guidance at this time. There’s no question that COVID-19 will have a meaningful impact on our commercial airline business. That said, volumes from our government customers are strong and are expected to continue to grow, and we have a substantial cargo business, which we see potentially expanding in this environment. As for airlines, air travel will return and grow, and aircraft will return to service, and demand for aftermarket parts and services will be required. On that note, we believe there will be opportunities for AAR as capital constraints, combined with low fuel prices, will likely cause airlines to cancel orders for new aircraft and possibly extend the utilization of existing aircraft. Additionally, there will be greater demand for used materials as airlines look to save money using aftermarket parts. And we, as the largest aftermarket parts supplier in the world, will benefit from increased supply as aircraft are retired. Moreover, we believe the competition in the aftermarket, which had grown in recent years due to the length of the upcycle, will decrease as our competitors struggle to survive or increasingly focus on their core activities. I want to reiterate that AAR is in a strong position. We are diversified across end markets and geographies and we have an exceptional balance sheet. I joined AAR just before 9/11, and I’ve seen what this company can do in times of adversity, and we are in even better position today heading into this event. I’m proud to be part of such an amazing team, and I’m confident that we will emerge even stronger. With that, I’ll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thanks.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn.
Robert Spingarn:
Good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hey, Rob.
Robert Spingarn:
John and Sean, obviously, this is a very challenging time. So, of course, we wish you the best as you work through this. I wanted to start by asking you if there’s anyway to frame, maybe perhaps on what you’ve seen so far through March or what you’re hearing from your customers? And based on these fairly heavy declines in capacity there that have started, if you have some sense for what the ASM decline looks like and how that relates to your business or the various businesses? Is there any algorithm that we can come up with?
John Holmes:
Well, not sure if there’s an algorithm, but let me try to take it piece by piece across the company. As we mentioned on the government side, in the past quarter, in the third quarter, we saw significant growth on the government side. And at this point, we see that continuing or we see the government business remaining strong and we expect continued growth there. Cargo as well, cargo through contracts that we have in our parts businesses, the supply engine providers or engine overall providers with parts for cargo customers, as well as some activity in the MRO business, we expect the cargo business to hold up and potentially expand, as I mentioned. In terms of airline customers and MRO, we are in constant contact with all of our major customers, and this is a very dynamic environment and really does change daily. Right now, we have a fair amount of work in the hangars. They’re largely full. But we anticipate a meaningful decline in that work, as we head towards the summer. We’re getting different information out of different customers at this time in terms of the schedules that they – they’re putting together. The one encouraging part of all of that is that we, for many of our MRO customers, are the main maintenance provider, and they recognize the importance of keeping solid lines of work with companies like us and us in particular and the message has been, we’ll do everything we can to keep it full. Now that said, we are expecting a meaningful decline in maintenance activity across the facilities as we head into the summer. And then in terms of the airline parts businesses, both new – or parts sales, both new and used, we would suggest that those – it’s early to tell and the business actually has been holding up, up until just the last few days. We did see some decline out of Asia in the third quarter and that’s continued. But the business has been holding up, but we have seen a decline just in the last few days. And we are anticipating that, that business tracks – the parts business tracks with – parts business and commercial PBH business tracks with ASMs.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Could you just refresh us on the percentage of the business that is cargo, I guess, of the overall top line?
John Holmes:
Yes. It’s not something we typically put out, but – and it fluctuates. But typically, we see it between 10% and 15% of the commercial business.
Robert Spingarn:
Of the commercial business. Okay. And the other thing I wanted to ask you, as we think about all these various pressures is – how would you describe your cost structure? I don’t know if this is for you or if it’s for Sean. But maybe the right way to ask it is your fixed versus variable cost, given the labor intensity, at least, part of your business?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. Given the nature of our business, you think about most of our cost is variable, because if you think about the parts supply activities, our cost of sales is obviously the inventory that we procure that we’d have on the shelf or we buy in the market. And the other parts of it are shipping and sales, right? So it’s really variable costs associated with activity. Where you have some greater fixed cost is on the infrastructure to support, obviously, the hangars and the MROs. Again, a lot of the labor there is more variable in nature in terms of contracts and the people that support the activity. And then in commercial programs, some of the infrastructure to support the supply chain has a more fixed nature to it. But – so I think we have a highly variable cost structure across the whole company. There are pockets where it’s a bit more variable part supply and some fixed costs in the hangars and other areas.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then just the last one for me is, how we should think about working capital trends from here? You obviously have parts inventory, given the decline in activity, do you draw that down? Do you continue to be active in parts? How do we think about working capital for the next few quarters to the best of your ability…
John Holmes:
Yes.
Robert Spingarn:
[Multiple Speakers] give us some sense?
Sean Gillen:
I think – yes, and I think, as you’re indicating there, this is definitely an evolving situation. We’re certainly in a mode right now, where we are drawing down on existing parts inventories. And as we see things settle out and as we see opportunities arise, we would look to potentially make investments. But right now, we are very focused on the liquidity required to operate the business and using the stock that we have to satisfy demand.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Thank you, both, for the color.
Operator:
Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from Canaccord.
Ken Herbert:
Yes. Hi, good afternoon, John and Sean.
John Holmes:
Hi, Ken.
Ken Herbert:
John, I just wanted to first ask about the commercial programs business. I mean, you called out, obviously, one contract you’ve exited, two you’ve restructured, how do we think about that business now in terms of what’s left? And how do you view the risk now that you’ve taken this action in these businesses? And is it pretty well level set moving forward?
John Holmes:
So I feel good about the actions that we took to address those contracts. They had been a headwind for us, as we’ve indicated over the last couple of quarters. So those were in response to restructurings that occurred within our customers. And so I’m happy that we were able to take those actions. And they will – as we said, they’ll provide an improvement in margin and an improvement in cash flow as a result of those actions. In the context, though, of COVID-19, power by the hour contracts, as the name implies, are built on flying hours of the airlines and we have seen reductions across all of those fleets that we support. And certain of those contracts have gotten minimum flight hour protections in there, although, we’re certainly in uncharted waters in terms of how those protections will be enforced. And so we’re in a dialogue with all of our customers about how our program support going forward will look, as they assess the impact of their own fleets as a result of COVID-19.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, that’s great. Thank you. And if I could just to follow-up on the earlier question, maybe one way to help us think about this is, as you look across specifically the parts supply and MRO businesses, obviously, the airlines seem to be cutting discretionary spending pretty aggressively. I’m just curious, from a timing standpoint, I would imagine you see that impact, certainly, on the parts trading and parts distribution fairly soon, maybe to your comment earlier, maybe on the the MRO side, there’s a bit of a lag. But then coming out of this, I would imagine, you’d see it on the trading and distribution side fairly quickly. But maybe can you just talk about how we should think about on those two parts of the business, the MRO and on the parts side, the timing and how this sort of rolls through the organization?
John Holmes:
Yes. On the parts side, I think, you have it right. We really, just in the last few days, have started to see decline evolve. It was actually decline in volume. It was actually holding up fairly well just into the last couple of days. And we would expect, as airlines ground fleet and look to cannibalize parts from aircraft that are on the ground, we would expect a meaningful decline in those day-to-day parts activities, both in terms of trade – specifically, in terms of trading, the distribution business that’s largely consumables expendables. So, that’s not – those aren’t parts that necessarily that would be cannibalized. But as airlines go through what they have on the shelf, we’ll see a slowdown and then we could see some replenishment orders there. But I expect overall, that volume on the new parts side to decrease as well. On the maintenance side, again, those are – provided the aircraft comes back, those are maintenance deferrals. And we would be working closely with our customers to make sure that we’re in a position to handle the maintenance events when they start to put aircraft back into service. And I would expect that activity to pace ahead of a recovery in the parts business.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, great. And just finally, can you just comment on what you’re seeing specifically out of China or maybe Asia? I mean, there has been some speculation that parts of the economy there and air travel, at least, within China seem to be picking up. Are you seeing that with your customers there? And how does that look outlook specifically look?
John Holmes:
Yes, great question. And the answer is we have. In the last two weeks, we have seen some activity, particularly out of China. Going into – about halfway through the third quarter, we started to see a meaningful decline in order volume out of China, in particular, and a bit less impacted across all of Asia. But in the last two weeks, we have seen a – some increased activity. As a matter of fact, last week, we received a multimillion dollar purchase order for landing gear from a Chinese carrier. And that’s a big order in any environment, particularly in this environment. So there definitely are signs of life with that market returning.
Ken Herbert:
Great. Thank you very much and good luck.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Ken.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi:
Hey, good evening, guys. John, can you just quantify a little bit more how much of the business you expect to track with ASMs, the deviation parts? Is that about $1 billion or so a year run rate?
John Holmes:
If we – we typically don’t split out those elements of the Aviation Services segment. But if you look at Aviation Services, it’s roughly a third, a third, a third; a third MRO, a third parts and then a third programs. And in the programs, it’s roughly split between government and commercial. So, we would see the commercial power by the hour programs tracking with ASMs. And then inside the parts business, with the exception of the government portion of that business and the cargo portion of that business, which I would put it a bit more than half, we would see the remaining half of the parts business tracking with ASM.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. And when you say tracking with ASMs, I mean, some of the U.S. airlines are talking about 70% to 80% declines in the next couple of months. Is that a ballpark of what you would expect?
John Holmes:
Yes.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. And then on the commercial piece, how much of the commercial business is with foreign airlines versus U.S. airlines between the MRO, parts and the PBH?
John Holmes:
Yes. Our commercial business is roughly about 40% international. So, when we talk about ASMs, I would look – I would weight that by geography, so call it, 40% international and 60% domestic.
Sean Gillen:
And as you know….
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay.
Sean Gillen:
...in the hangars that’s five in the U.S., which I think services the domestic narrow-body market, two in Canada, similar dynamic there; and then some landing gear facility in Miami; and then two component repair facilities in New York and Amsterdam. So within MRO, specifically, its overweight towards the domestic U.S. market and Canada.
Joseph DeNardi:
Got it. Okay. And then Sean, can you just talk about kind of liquidity? How much you think you have access to, and when you would look to access some of that?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. So, as I mentioned in my script, we have about $435 million of liquidity, the revolver we upsized back just in the fall. So the maturity is until 4.5 years from now in the fall of 2024, and we upsized it to $100 million to $600 million in total at that time. And that’s the available liquidity the company has. We also put in an AAR financing program a couple of years ago and there’s some availability under that. So, in terms of where we sit today on liquidity, I think, we feel good. We’re obviously contingency planning and in discussions with our banks to make sure that it stays the same. But feel good about the actions that we’ve taken over the last, call it, six months and where we sit today.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. And then just one more – yes go ahead.
Sean Gillen:
Yes, I’d add. The actions we’re obviously taking, both in terms of overhead and fixed costs are all with an eye to improving the cost, as well as the cash position of the company.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. And then, John or Sean, can you just kind of frame the cost reduction actions you put in place, how much of that was COVID-19 versus the underperforming contracts? And then what sort of revenue environment does that assume? And when would you maybe look to do more if things get worse?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. So the Q3 charge is the $24.7 million, that’s obviously specific to the restructuring actions in the programs. The $15 million to $20 million range estimate we provided for Q4 are for the Q4 actions, provided for the facility actions, as well as the people and overhead action. That split roughly evenly between kind of facility actions and people actions. And I’d say, that reflects a demand environment with tracks to some of the things you talked about here in terms of activity in the hangars and ASM, should things deteriorate, we’re watching the situation closely. It’s still relatively early. As we mentioned in the script, we would be ready to take additional action if needed.
Joseph DeNardi:
Thank you.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here.
John Holmes:
Hi, Mike.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Maybe, John or Sean, just to go back, the two underperforming contracts on the commercial side, can you give us a little background as to what went wrong there? Maybe what kind of prevents that from happening going forward? I always thought, once you got those contracts locked and loaded, they would be pretty well off and good performing over the life of the program. So can you give us a little background there?
John Holmes:
Yes. In both situations, you had fleet changes that occurred at the customer, that drove a pretty significant – difference between what was impacted, or what was expected when we signed the contract versus what we actually felt. And we – we’ve had negotiations with those customers in recent months to try to correct for that. And ultimately, we ended up in a position where we needed to restructure the contract and take charge. That’s the element of the customer side of it. On our side, we had a pretty rapid expansion into that business. If you recall, we signed up a lot of contracts and – with a lot of different operators and a lot of different environments. And it was a pretty stretched supply chain. And these were some of the earliest agreements that we signed, as we got into that business. And our pricings, our operations and the contractual protections that we look for in those agreements evolved over that period of time. But these were one of – these were earlier agreements in that regard.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. That’s helpful, and maybe that’s a good segue. I kind of hate to ask this sobering question. But as you guys look, you have a better view than us. As you look at your customer lists, specifically, carriers on a global basis. I mean, have you guys done any sort of an analysis on bankruptcy analysis or how many of these carriers might be forced to consolidate? I mean, you just said you had some rapid expansion there. I mean, is it – are you looking that customer by customer and seeing who might be at risk here and where some of these long-term contracts might not prove to be valid anymore?
John Holmes:
I would say, we’re taking a look at the liquidity position of all of our customers, and I wouldn’t limit that statement to just our commercial power by the hour contract orders. We’re looking across the whole portfolio. And having said that, our largest customers, we feel very good about their own financial management and we’ve got very close relationships with them and are in very active dialogue with them in terms of our exposure and their plan. So, overall, I feel good about our AR portfolio. Having said that, we’re certainly in an environment where you are going to see some failures. And we’ve done our own analysis on where those may occur and we’re going to do everything we can to limit our exposure.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. If there is a silver lining, thinking about parts trading, distribution, I mean, do you guys – maybe, Sean, do you envision sort of a countercyclical sort of cash tailwind here? I mean, if you guys do, in fact, liquidate inventory might be resizing in the near-term for much lower volumes? I mean, can we expect maybe some improved cash generation if you’re clearly not investing on the parts side of the business?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. I think, as you mentioned, obviously, over the last few years in a growth environment, where we’ve not only been outgrowing the industry, taking share as part of that. It’s been a – it’s somewhat capital-intensive business in terms of the inventory and the notable assets we’ve invested into support that growth. As you sit here today with the balance sheet we have and the inventory position, to your point, we’re obviously very, very focused on turning the inventory position, the investments we made into cash. So I think you’ll see maybe a higher conversion on inventory as you put less on the shelf and monetize what we have. As we talked about here, I do think that in the environment we’re in, that will be what we’re driving to. And then in terms of some of the other levers on the balance sheet, AR and AP, specifically, we’re going to manage both of those, given the current environment.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. And just the last…
John Holmes:
Yes, I would…
Michael Ciarmoli:
Sorry?
John Holmes:
Sorry, Mike, I was just going to add that, we do expect to see opportunities as a result of this market dislocation and we see opportunities in terms of potential asset acquisition opportunities, in terms of potential talent acquisition. And we do see clearing out, to Sean’s point, of some of the competition that has come into the market, both from small players that may exit completely and very large players that may decide they want to focus on other things. So, we’ve been here a long time. We’ve seen versions of these things before. And a big reason why we maintain such a strong balance sheet is so that we can come out of situations like this even stronger.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Yes. No, I would agree, John. I think that makes a lot of sense. The last one, just on the parts trading. I mean, I generally agree that we might see some older inventory, older planes in service longer, but we still might see a reduced fleet. We could even see older planes be retired and excess parts in the marketplace, which may pressure pricings. Do we have to think about the prices of some of the inventory you’re carrying? And do you guys ultimately view that as a longer-term opportunity? Would you be opportunistic if you see some really attractive parts out there for some of the popular platforms, whether they’re 320s or 737s, would you go after them, if there is a little bit of a near-term dislocation pricing in the marketplace?
John Holmes:
Yes, definitely. The answer to that is absolutely. We want to time that correctly, because we’re in a mode here where we need to see how things are going to shape up, but absolutely. And I would mention that we’ve talked about this for several quarters now. The demand for aftermarket material has far, far are exceeded the supply in the last several quarters. And so, obviously, you’re going to have a meaningful decline in demand and an increase in supply. But given our position and given the relationship that we have and the network we have to get our hands on the best material out there, we’re – we should be in a position to, even though it might be lower demand, fulfill more of it as a percentage and we have been able to in the past as a result of more material coming on the market. And that’s our job is to make sure that, we time that correctly and make the right investments and get our hands on that choice material, as you referenced before anyone else.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Helpful. I’ll jump back in the queue. Good luck you guys.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
Next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn:
Thanks. I wanted to come back in with two things. One, just on the back of Mike’s question there, may be the opposite take, might some models essentially go out of service here, older models that might obsolesce some of the inventory?
John Holmes:
Yes, that could happen. That could happen. And…
Robert Spingarn:
Are you exposed anything, in particular, that would be notable if you had to write that off?
John Holmes:
Yes. I wouldn’t cite any asset class, in particular, at this point. But that’s certainly something we’re paying close attention to. And it’s – a lot of the inventory that we carry is tied to long-term contracts. And again, there was a bow wave of maintenance events that – where the demand outstrip the amount of inventory that we could find. So even if you do see some early retirements or an overall decrease in demand, we feel pretty good about the inventory position that we’ve got right now.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then the other thing I just wanted to go back to and you mentioned this earlier was, what a potential spike in aircraft retirements might mean for the business, if you could elaborate on that a little bit? And how you guys fit into that, because I think it’s a less discussed area of the business at least recently. And then how customer behavior might be changing in terms of acceptance of USM?
John Holmes:
Yes. I think it’s important to remember that USM is a lower-cost solution. And in environments like this, where airlines are really managing their costs much more closely than they have been before, you may see greater adoption of USM. And that would be a fortunate development to the extent that we see greater USM on the right platforms become available on the market. So, that is a dynamic that we could see play out and we’ve seen that play out in past with dislocations as well.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator:
Next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi:
Yes, thanks. John, just on the defense business, it sounds like it’s more or less business as usual there. Is that right? Or are you seeing some degree of labor disruption with some folks not being able to get where they need to be? Thank you.
John Holmes:
Sure. No, it’s been – as I mentioned, we had a very good quarter and our defense government programs revenues were up meaningfully in the quarter. And so it’s largely business as usual. I’d add that, the pipelines for us on the government side has continued to grow. Those awards take a long time due to the procurement process, as well as the protest process inside of the government. But we’ve built a great franchise. We’re able to bid on more contracts than we ever have been before because of our broad-based past portfolio – or past performance portfolio. And I would expect to continue to see growth there, but it’s going to come in chunks as these contracts are awarded over time.
Joseph DeNardi:
Thank you.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
Next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey, thanks, again, for taking this one. John, just to follow-up. You were kind of hitting on it with the USM is lower cost and you could see greater adoption. What are your thoughts on MRO right now, given what you’re seeing with the domestic carriers? You guys are usually a lower-cost option. Do you think some of your customers reevaluate what they’re doing in-house right now? Or do you think there’s more – they’re trying to support their workforce and their employees? How do you think that evolves on the MRO side?
John Holmes:
I think you could – I think that’s a good point. I think you could see some net new work come on to the market. Given the environment as airlines look to – if they – if they’re looking to alter a union agreement or another contract that might allow them to outsource work, this would certainly be a backdrop to do that. So we could see net new work come on the market. I would also expect that you may have seen some of the domestic competitors not make this through. So you could see, at least, for a period of time, a contraction in the amount of available hangar space. And while we’re very focused and, as I mentioned, we’ve been in dialogue with the government about potential aid to preserve our workforce, to the extent that there are new mechanics that are on the market, we could be in a position to bring on a workforce to expand capacity, to the extent that’s necessary. But there’s so many moving parts right now. It’s difficult to forecast how all that is going to play out. And right now, we just want to make sure that we’ve got our cost base rightsized to support the demand that we see over the next few quarters.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. And what should we be thinking about labor rates? I mean, obviously, this is a pretty fluid environment right now, but do we see a quick downtick in labor rates or how do you guys think that plays out?
John Holmes:
I think it’s a little early to speculate on that. I do think that a lot of that does have to do with what the government – what actions the government takes and what potential aid may be out there to preserve workforce. To the extent that there’s not aid available. You may see a supply of labor come on to the market that we haven’t seen in several years and that could impact labor rates. But right now, it’s pretty early to tell.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. All right. Thanks, guys. Helpful.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
Next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from Canaccord.
Ken Herbert:
Hey, John, I appreciate the follow-up. In the last couple of quarters, you’ve talked about PMA, specifically, is maybe a growth opportunity or area of investment. Does the recent developments change your thinking on that?
John Holmes:
No, not as a long-term strategy. We continue to believe that as well as the inclusion of all – as well as the inclusion of greater intellectual property generally defined in our portfolio, whether that’s PMAs, DERs, digital, et cetera, all of that is part of the long-term strategy. That said, as you can imagine, we are taking a look at all of our investment projects right now, and we’re going to moderate those or pace those with how we see the demand for the core services unfolding.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. And as we follow the sort of the various scenarios on potential bailouts for the airlines and other parts of sort of the ecosystem, are there any specific aspects of that you’re watching or that would be particularly helpful for AAR, whether it be on the parts supply or the MRO side? I mean, as you watch this development, would you specifically be pushing for lobbying for as part of some sort of bailout package?
John Holmes:
Well, our conversations with the government, again, I’ve been personally involved in a lot of these over the last several days. Our points are that, a bailout or aid package needs to address more than just the airlines. It needs to address the broader Aviation Services industry, because companies like ours, particularly around heavy maintenance are a vital link in keeping the aircraft in the United States flying. And many airlines have outsourced those activities and they no longer have the capability. And giving us the tightening – given the tightness in labor that we’ve seen over the last few years, we want to make sure that to the extent that there is a decrease in demand, and technicians are let go from various companies, including our own that we’re able to – or is that – as other industries recover faster than aviation might, we don’t lose those technicians to other industries. And we want to make sure that we preserve that heavy maintenance capability, in particular, in America. So our conversations have been largely around providing aid to companies like ours, either in the form of grants or loans with forgiveness that would be directed towards preserving the workforce.
Ken Herbert:
Great. Thank you very much.
Operator:
At this time, we have no questions on the phone line.
John Holmes:
Okay. Well, again, thank you, everybody, for your interest and support, and we really appreciate the time.

December 19, 2019
Operator:
Good afternoon everyone and welcome to the AAR's Fiscal 2020 Second Quarter Earnings Call. We're joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31st, 2019. In providing the forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. We really appreciate you all being here to join us today to discuss our second quarter FY 2020 results. In the second quarter FY 2020, sales grew by 13.7% from $493.3 million to $560.9 million. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from $0.60 a share to $0.64 per share. We had a great quarter, and I'm really pleased with our overall results. Once again, we saw exceptionally strong performance from our trading activities as we continue to use our global network to source the highest demand material to support our long-term customer contracts. We saw strong results from our distribution activities as well, having benefited from the maturation of contracts secured over the last several quarters. We also continue to see solid growth from our government programs activities. WASS and Landing Gear PBL contract, in particular, are performing very well operationally and are allowing us to build solid past performance as a foundation to capture more government opportunities. The second quarter was also our fourth consecutive quarter of improved performance in our MRO business. The actions taken to address the shortage of mechanics, such as enhancing our recruiting efforts, partnering with various schools, and repositioning elements of our workforce across our network have paid off and we are seeing benefits of those actions now. In addition to the strong financial performance, we also announced several new awards during the quarter. Our Airinmar subsidiary, a provider of component repair cycle management solutions, announced two new contracts. This was with -- the first was with Alaska Airlines for Airvolution, which is a software platform that enables the customer to increase efficiency and reduce costs by increasing visibility into their component repair cycle. Airvolution is our first Software-as-a-Service offering, or SaaS, and I'm thrilled to have Alaska using our platform. In addition to this award, we continue to see very significant revenue growth for our other businesses through the digital channels that we have built over the last two years. Airinmar also signed a contract with JetBlue to provide component value engineering to help reduce repair costs. We're excited about these two awards as they represent new services to existing customers, which validates our integrated services model. Finally, we expanded our component repair services agreement with BAE Systems to include a wider range of components for its regional jet support programs. BAE sighted our consistent cost savings and the high-quality delivered by our Amsterdam facility as the basis for this expansion. Before turning it over to Sean, I would like to provide an update on the sale of our Airlift COCO business, which is in discontinued operations. I'm pleased to share that we've completed the sale of all of our DoD contracts and are awaiting regulatory approval for one remaining foreign contract, which we expect to receive soon. Once received, the exit of our Airlift COCO business in discontinued operations will be complete. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Sean Gillen.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks John. Our sales in the quarter of $560.9 million were up 13.7% or $67.6 million year-over-year. This included a $69.1 million or 14.9% increase in Aviation Services revenues, driven by execution on new contract awards and strong demand in our part supply activities. Gross profit increased 9.7% or $7.6 million to $85.9 million. Gross margin within Aviation Services remained relatively flat at 16.1% for the quarter, which was favorably impacted by improvement in MRO and offset by some mix in government services and increased costs in certain commercial PBH programs. While we did see increased costs in certain programs, some of the increase can be attributed to improving the operational turnaround time by more quickly closing repair orders. We are taking actions to address these increased costs, such as optimizing our vendor network and inventory pool, as well as in-sourcing repair work. Consolidated gross margin was 15.3% versus 15.9% in the prior year period, primarily due to Expeditionary Services. Our mobility activities had a softer quarter due to a contract award not being finalized in the period and some operational challenges, including raw material inflation and warranty issues. Our composite activities also had weaker performance due to mix, labor inefficiency, and higher freight costs. While overall performance should recover in the second half of the year, we are taking action to reduce overhead as well as evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs. SG&A expenses were 10.2% of sales versus 10.0% in the prior period, which was largely driven by investigation and compliance-related costs. Excluding investigation and severance costs, which totaled $3.3 million, SG&A would have been 9.6% of sales in the quarter. Our income tax expense during the quarter was $6 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23%. Net interest expense was $1.8 million compared to $2.4 million last year due to lower borrowings and rates. During the quarter, our cash flow provided from operating activities from continuing operations was $19.9 million, which improved $35.3 million from the prior year, excluding the impact of the accounts receivable financing program, which was relatively flat this quarter. During the quarter, we returned $6.7 million to shareholders via a dividend of $0.075 per share or $2.6 million and repurchased 100,000 shares for $4.1 million. The balance sheet remains strong with net debt at $160.1 million and net leverage at 0.9 times. Before handing the call back to John, I want to provide an update on the Department of Justice Investigation at Airlift regarding potential violations of the False Claims Act, which we disclosed in 2018 and with which we've been cooperating. We have recently entered into settlement discussions with the DoJ, we are happy to take a step towards resolving this matter. However, there is no assurance that any settlement will be achieved. We will keep you updated as these discussions progress. Thank you for your attention, and I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. Due to the strong performance in the first half of the year, we are updating our FY 2020 guidance and now expect sales to be between $2.15 billion and $2.225 billion. We now expect adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.50 a share to $2.65 a share. Compared to our prior financial guidance, the midpoint of our revised sales guidance increased from $2.15 billion to $2.188 billion and the midpoint of our revised adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from $2.55 a share to $2.58 a share. We continue to expect SG&A expenses to be approximately 10.5% of sales and anticipate an effective tax rate of 24% in FY 2020. We will continue to reassess our guidance and modify it, if necessary, as the year progresses. As it relates to the cadence of our earnings over the balance of the year, we would expect to have modest sequential growth in the third quarter and then more significant sequential growth in the fourth quarter. In closing, our parts supply activity has continued to deliver exceptional performance. We're executing well on our government programs wins, and we're very pleased with recovery that we see in the MRO activities. We've got a strong balance sheet, full pipeline of new business opportunities, and we look forward to a very successful second half of FY 2020. And with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
Hi guys. Good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hey Rob, how are you doing?
Robert Spingarn:
Good thanks. Nice quarter, some nice cash flow here. I wanted to go back, you just talked about the midpoint of your revenue guidance, the $2.188 billion. And that implies about 6.5% growth for the year, if I'm doing the math right, but you're about 15% so far this year. So, a couple of things here. One, I'm thinking maybe the back end is a little conservative, though the moving parts. I don't know if something is rolling off. You've added a fair amount of work. And then I wanted to talk about that in terms of the two segments, because sort of no matter what Expeditionary does in the second half and it's flattish for the year, one would expect or -- it seems you're implying that the growth at Aviation Services softens a bit. You did say the cadence into Q3 is maybe soft and then you strengthen in Q4. So, all that together, how does the second half look?
John Holmes:
Yes. Well, again, we're really proud of the first half. It's been a great start to the year. And as we think about the second half, you do come up against tougher comps versus last year because that was about when we started to see some recovery in the MRO business, so that drives a bit of it. You did mention Expeditionary Services. As Sean mentioned, we are expecting a recovery in the second half, although, it will likely be below the plan that we originally developed when we presented the guidance originally. But overall, we're happy that we're in a position to have raised the guidance overall for the year, and this represents the best view of the opportunities that we see at this time.
Robert Spingarn:
So, could you conceivably see -- I mean, does Expeditionary get better at any point? What's the long-term objective there?
John Holmes:
So, Expeditionary -- right now, we're focused, as we said, on improving the performance of that business. And part of what happened this quarter was situational, we had some operational issues that we've worked through. And then we've also seen some awards get delayed from the government and we expect to come those -- those to come through during the second half of the year. Depending on when those hit, obviously, will drive the performance in the second half of the year. But as we've talked about, Rob, for a long time, our focus as a company, generally speaking, has been growing and building out the Aviation Services segment, and that's where the investment, that's where the focus has been. And that's where you've seen the growth. So, that's the long-term future of the company.
Robert Spingarn:
Yes, I was going to say, even with the tough comps, if I just use your numbers really implying no absolute increase in the back half of the year. And again, with these contracts that you've been feathering in all along, I'm just going to take that as conservatism. And then -- so that's a comment more than a question. Last question, though, on the Software-as-a-Service contracts that you mentioned, very interesting this evolution and so on. Who are you competing with on these?
John Holmes:
That is a great question, and I like our answer. There's nothing like that in the market. It's the only application that gives you the type of visibility that -- the type of visibility that we do into the component repair supply chain and it also allows customers to share data. We need more customers to get on the platform and share their data with us. But in an anonymized way on an individual component level, customers can now compare the price that they're paying against the community. And that's a feature that we're seeing a great deal of interest in. So, I mean, from a financial standpoint, that's a -- it's a very small contributor to the overall results right now, but it's our first foray into an actual software program, and we're really excited that Alaska is on board.
Robert Spingarn:
And do you have any partners on this product? Is this developed in-house or are there any other folks that are -- do a technical side for you?
John Holmes:
Well, yes, we definitely have technical partners that help us do the -- help us develop the platform. But those are more kind of on a consulting basis as opposed to any significant commercial relationship. And we have a number of technical partners that are helping us build out the rest of the digital solutions. And as I mentioned, we're seeing a really significant increase of revenue through the digital channels that we've developed for our traditional businesses over the last couple of years.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Thanks very much. I'll jump out and come back later.
John Holmes:
Thanks Rob.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert of Canaccord. Your line is open.
Ken Herbert:
Hi, good afternoon Sean and John.
John Holmes:
Hey Ken.
Ken Herbert:
Hey, I just wanted to first ask your gross margins within Aviation Services, you called out some headwinds from some of your government services contracts, but then also it sounds like on commercial programs, you've seen some higher-than-expected costs there. I wanted to see if you could parse that out between those for us? And then specifically on the commercial program side, it sounds like this is a business that's maybe not getting as much capital as it has in the past. Can you talk about some of the -- maybe the headwinds you're seeing in that business, whether it be pricing or higher costs and maybe how we should think about that business for you longer term?
John Holmes:
Sure. As we think about gross profit, there were some -- the positives are continued exceptional performance out of the parts businesses and the recovery in MRO. The two areas that we're offsetting to that, as Sean mentioned, one was, as you mentioned, government programs. Now, we don't see headwind in government programs, we actually see a great deal of growth and very strong performance out of that area of the company. But the way those work, they're dilutive to the gross profit number, but accretive to our operating margin. So, that mix there is a pretty meaningful impact this quarter. And we would expect it to be an impact going forward, given the growth of that business. On commercial programs, we've talked the last several quarters about the market there. And we have seen increased competition and the pricing has been driven down as a result for that market. We continue to compete, we -- but as we've talked about, we have certain return requirements. If we can't meet those return requirements, we're not going to take the deal. On existing contracts, we have seen some cost headwinds on certain of the contracts. As Sean mentioned, we're working to address those. Some of that though is timing and situational that you saw in this quarter and that's because in certain of the contracts, we -- in order to improve operational performance, we accelerated the web. And so that had the effect of pulling costs forward, which we saw in this quarter. And also because of the accounting changes that took place last year, a number of these contracts are now on a cash basis as opposed to managed over time. So, you do see fluctuations in income in any given quarter as a result of those cost changes. But as you pointed out, we haven't announced a new win in that area in a little while and so -- and it's still an important part of our portfolio. Having said that, we've been able to achieve what we believe is very significant growth across the company. Double-digit growth now for six quarters in a row and that's not -- that's being driven by other areas outside of commercial programs.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. No, that's helpful. It makes a lot of sense. It seems like a very competitive market. And as we look at the guidance increase, again, just a question again within Aviation Services and the growth there. It's fair to assume then that the parts business, trading and distribution and maybe some on the government side with those contracts is obviously driving the increase? Or is on the top line? Or is maybe better performance on the MRO, a material piece of that as well?
John Holmes:
It's all of the above. Very strong performance out of trading, very healthy year-over-year growth there, continued strong performance from the new parts business, very nice growth out of the government programs area, those contracts have matured. And as you pointed out, the recovery in the MRO business is meaningful as well.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. And if I could, just one final question. On -- I know you've talked more recently about government services and the opportunities, and it sounds like WASS and the PBL contract are going well within Aviation Services. Can you provide any data, John, on maybe the bids you're seeing, the opportunities, maybe what might be flowing through in terms of your bid pipeline or your backlog? Or I mean, it sounds like now there's obviously a real high focus on these types of contracts from your customer base here in the United States, in particular, and I'm just wondering, maybe are you capturing more as a scenario where we should continue to see or expect strong growth? And maybe just a little bit about some of your activity underneath the two contracts you talked about moving forward for that business?
John Holmes:
Sure, sure. A couple of thoughts there. Yes, you should expect to see continued growth out of that government services business, and we have a very full pipeline. And the point that we made on our past performance is the more we win, the more we're able to win because we build more experience, which allows us to bid on more types of work. So, that is widening the aperture of the types of things that we can pursue. On top of that, we've really successfully made the migration from a subcontractor to a prime contractor over the last four or five years, and that, again, is helping us bid these larger programs. And we're also taking advantage of the fact that we just won, as you know, two quarters ago, the C-40 contract to sell two aftermarket aircraft to the government. And that is a great example of the government accessing the aftermarket. And on that, the original solicitation that came out for those two aircraft was originally written for only the purchase of two new aircraft. And we worked in DC to allow that solicitation to allow the sourcing of two used aircraft, and ultimately, we're successful in winning that. That we believe is going to open up more doors for us, not just for used aircraft sales, but for also to use part sales and we see a lot of opportunity coming there. I was just at a DoD Maintenance Symposium, I gave a keynote speech last week there, and we talked a lot about the DoD making better use of well-established aftermarket solutions as it looks to go ahead and increase the sustainment and the readiness of the fleet, but doing that in a more cost-effective way. And there was a lot of interest as we gave these commercial examples of -- and their application to the government environment. So, we remain very excited about the growth prospects for us in government services.
Ken Herbert:
Great. Thank you very much. Nice quarter.
John Holmes:
Thanks Ken.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of SunTrust. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey, good evening guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Nice quarter.
John Holmes:
Thanks Mike.
Michael Ciarmoli:
John, just can we go back to -- maybe just to close the loop on, I think, what Rob was talking about on the digital solutions. Do you compete at all? I know Honeywell's got, I think their GoDirect trading -- what's the difference between -- yes, what's the difference? How are you guys differentiating your solution versus their solution? I mean, there just seems to be a part store, I guess, but are you guys doing anything radically different to entice more customers to sell that solution? Can you just maybe articulate a little bit there?
John Holmes:
Sure. There's a handful of digital initiatives that we've got. Some are external and some are internal. Quickly, in the internal, we've done a lot of work to put more information and take advantage of data that we collect from our heavy maintenance activities and our power-by-the-hour activities and our part sales activities and use that data to get more information in front of our employees real-time so that we can capture sales more quickly. From an external standpoint, we do have our parts store. We're seeing a lot of traffic through that store. We've seen a very, very healthy month-over-month increases of traffic through that store. And we've seen a broader acceptance of small and large customers in terms of transacting business digitally as opposed to phones and emails. So, we're excited about that. I wouldn't want to necessarily compare us to -- there's a lot of people there, as you mentioned, the Honeywell GoDirect, there's ePlane [ph], there's AeroBuy, there's all kinds of different platforms out there. One of the reasons we are successful is because this is what we do. This is a core business for us, and we're taking what we do and what we do very, very well and applying it to a digital channel. So, I remain very excited about what we're seeing there.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the strength in the parts trading, I mean, clearly, we continue to see this robust activity in the aftermarket. It looks like shop visits, overhauls, everything on the schedule into next year, looks like that strength continues. Are you seeing any incremental upside from the grounding of the MAX? I mean, is that creating more tightness around 37 parts of availability and giving you more pricing power? Can you just maybe give a little color on how that's factoring into the performance of trading, if at all?
John Holmes:
Yes. No, I mean, net-net, the MAX is a positive for us. And we've said before that it's neutral to slightly positive right now, but it's definitely positive over the long-term because it extends the life of the current generation platforms. As it relates to material availability, there's no question, 737 material is very, very tight. But we are the best in the world of sourcing that material and sourcing it at the right price. As a matter of fact, we just closed on two aircraft actually recently, and we're really happy that we made that buying and we're able to get our hands on that because that's great material that will help us in the second half. So, the fact that we are -- we've got -- we're the largest in the world for this, we've got the best network of buyers and the sourcing team around the world, and we've got the balance sheet capacity and flexibility to close faster than anybody we compete with, that's giving us an edge in that market. On top of that, we also have the best set of contracts, particularly with the engine shops for long-term supply agreements. So, when we go out and we find the right material, we've got the capital to deploy quickly, and we know we've got it sold because we got the contract.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. That's helpful. And then just to nitpick, maybe a little bit on the Aviation margins. I mean, I'm assuming all of this parts trading activity is margin accretive to some of the other services and revenue-generating activities in the Aviation business. The margins have been flattish, down slightly year-over-year. I think you did talk about some of the turn times and looking at cost there and in-sourcing. But how do we think about any potential operating leverage in Aviation Services? I mean, I would imagine the parts trading can't continue to stay this active. Should we think about you guys having some levers to pull to either sustain the margins or drive some upside once parts trading sort of normalizes?
John Holmes:
Well, I would say, just on parts trading, I mean, we expect this heightened level of activity to continue for a long time. And that was well before the MAX grounding happened because of the contract that we have, the forecast we see from the shop and the bow wave of maintenance business that's expected to occur over the next couple of years. So, we feel very good about that business and the continued strength for many quarters to come. In terms of overall margin, it's a big focus of ours. We are focused on improving that number. MRO is not yet back at the level that it was two years ago. We're headed that way. Each quarter, we make a little bit of improvement, but that is still depressed from where it was a couple of years ago because our labor cost increased and we have not yet passed that entire cost on to the customer. The customers are being very supportive. They've got their own cost pressures and they're working with us, but we still have some work to do there. On top of that, we did bring in a lot of new talent, and that talent takes a while to get trained and get good at what they do and ultimately become more efficient on the floor. And as that happens, we expect to see continued margin improvement in MRO. And then as Sean mentioned on the commercial program, there are definitely some cost challenges that we've seen recently there, and we're taking a number of actions to address those. And as we work through that, we would expect to see margin improvement there, too.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Helpful. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks guys.
John Holmes:
Thanks Mike.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan of Seaport Global. Your line is open.
Josh Sullivan:
Hey, good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hey Josh.
Josh Sullivan:
How do you feel about the inventory in your trading business? You talked about that bow wave maintenance coming up. Do you still feel the need to build that inventory in your network? Or is it that network that you have that you feel like you can trade on a spot basis that's giving you confidence?
John Holmes:
We have been making continued investments in the inventory, so that investment has actually grown over the last few quarters. The turns have also improved, so we're seeing material come in and go out. But candidly, the demand is so significant that wherever we can find material, we get it, and often, we're able to move it very quickly. So, we have investment plans, et cetera, but those investment plans have to be flexible when we come across opportunities to get our hands on the right stuff.
Josh Sullivan:
Got it. And then just another follow-up on the SaaS strategy. How is price discovery going? Are these trials still or have you firmed up pricing and margin at this point?
John Holmes:
I'm sorry, what was the -- on what exactly?
Josh Sullivan:
On the SaaS strategy with the digital initiative, yes.
John Holmes:
Okay. Yes. It's -- I would characterize that as very, very early, very early. So, we've got a launch customer. We have multiple other customers that we're talking about right now. And I would say, to use your words, we are in the phase of price discovery.
Josh Sullivan:
Got it. And then just one last one on the MRO market, where is utilization on MRO shop visits year-over-year at this point?
John Holmes:
We are -- well, for us, we are up year-over-year. We're sold out through the rest of the year. And we have seen customers move work around, largely as a result of scheduled changes due to the MAX. But we -- from our standpoint, we're at a very high utilization.
Sean Gillen:
And I would say our utilization last year was constrained by labor, rather than pure capacity. And so our labor position is better. So, we're at a higher utilization. But the constraint continues to be labor overall in that market.
John Holmes:
I think that's a good point. The macro environment for labor has not improved year-over-year. It's our position within that environment. Thanks to the actions that we've taken have allowed us to make this recovery.
Josh Sullivan:
Thank you.
John Holmes:
All great. Thanks Josh.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I'm showing no questions at this time.
John Holmes:
Well, great, everyone. We really appreciate your time and your interest in our company and we wish everybody happy holidays.

September 25, 2019
Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019. In providing the forward-looking statement, the Company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances, or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great, thank you very much, and good afternoon everybody. I really appreciate you all being here to joining us today to discuss our Q1 FY20 results. Our positive momentum continued with another quarter of double-digit sales growth. In the first quarter of FY20, sales grew 16% from $466.3 million to $541.5 million. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from $0.54 per share to $0.57 per share. We continue to see exceptional performance from our parts supply and government programs activities. And MRO, as you know, we took several actions last year to address labor shortages such as enhancing our recruiting efforts, partnering with various schools, and repositioning elements of our workforce across our network. We are pleased with the positive impact of these actions, which resulted in our third quarter of improvement in MRO. We are also pleased with the support that we received from our customers to better level out the maintenance schedule throughout the year. This allowed us to keep more of the workforce in place during the slower summer season. During the quarter, we were awarded a $118 million contract from the Naval Air Systems Command in support of the US Marine Corps for the procurement, modification, and delivery of two C-40 aircraft. This award demonstrates the power of our integrated services model by combining the strengths of our parts supply, government programs, MRO, and engineering teams to deliver a creative solution to the US Marine Corps. The ability to deliver an overhaul versus factory new solution not only differentiates AAR from our competitors in the defense space but also demonstrates our ability to once again apply commercial best practices to deliver a more cost-effective solution to the U.S. government. We began work under this contract this past quarter, and we expect to deliver the aircraft in our fiscal 2021. Subsequent to the quarter end, we announced a new parts distribution award from Leach Corporation, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of TransDigm. As part of this agreement, AAR OEM Solutions will be the Company's main distributor for electromechanical and solid-state switch gears to OEMs for new production, as well as to the -- both the commercial and military aftermarket. This is an important win for the Company and reaffirms the strength of our value proposition in parts supply and distribution. We also announced a new agreement with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Aero Engines to supply PW4000 engine parts in support of their engine overhaul business. This is our largest commercial contract in Japan to-date, and we're particularly proud about this win, because it allows us to support the demand for engine parts in this growing market. We continue to execute on our growth strategy, and we're pleased with the progress as we continue to secure and execute on new business wins, and we're very excited about the strong start to FY20. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Sean Gillen.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Our sales in the quarter of $541.5 million were up 16% or $75.2 million year-over-year. This included $73.4 million or 17% increase in Aviation Services revenues, driven by execution on new contract awards and strong demand in our part supply activities. The C-40 award contributed approximately $19 million of sales in the quarter. Gross profit increased 14.6% or $10 million to $81.6 million. Gross margin was 15.1% versus 15.3% in the prior year period, primarily due to Expeditionary Services. Gross Margin within Aviation Services, however, improved from 15.3% to 15.6%. I would note that the C-40 award, while relatively in line with operating income margins and accretive to ROIC, is a bit dilutive to gross margin. SG&A expenses were 10.7% of sales versus 10.3% in the prior period, which reflects increased investigation and compliance-related costs mentioned in the previous quarter as well as some additional sales and quality resources. Excluding the investigation and severance costs, which totaled $3.6 million, SG&A would have been 10.1% of sales in the quarter. Regarding the investigation, we have received request for information from the government agencies involved, which we are fully cooperating with. Beyond that, we cannot provide further detail at this time. Our income tax expense during the quarter was favorably impacted by tax benefits of $1.4 million, related to the vesting of restricted shares and stock option exercises. This compares to a similar tax benefits of $2.5 million related to stock compensation in prior year's quarter. Net interest expense was $2.1 million compared to $1.6 million last year. During the quarter, our cash flow used from operating activities from continuing operations was $30 million, which improved $20 million from the prior year, excluding the impact of the accounts receivable financing program, which was flat in this quarter. The cash used in this quarter was primarily driven by investments in inventory to support our part supply activities as well as some normal seasonality in MRO. We feel good about the strength of the balance sheet. Net debt ended the quarter at $163.4 million with net leverage below one-turn. In addition, I am pleased to share that we entered into an extension of our revolving credit facility, which will add an additional three years to the term and $100 million of borrowing capacity. Our lowest pricing will also decrease from LIBOR plus 100 basis points to LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points with no other significant changes. Details of the extension will be filed this week. Finally, we are still on target to close the sale of our GOCO business before the end of calendar 2019. The exit of this business is consistent with the realignment of our strategy to GOCO. Thank you for your attention, and I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, Sean. We're very pleased with our Q1 results. And as you saw on the earnings release, we are reaffirming our FY20 guidance for sales to be between $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.45 a share to $2.65 a share. We continue to expect SG&A expenses to be approximately 10.5% of sales and anticipate an effective tax rate of 24% in FY20. We will continue to reassess our guidance and modify it, if necessary, as the year progresses. We are really excited about the strong start to the year. Our parts supply activities continue to deliver exceptional performance. We are executing on our government programs wins, and we're very pleased with the recovery that we see in the MRO business. We have a full pipeline of new business opportunities, and we look forward to a very successful FY20. Thank you for your time and interest in AAR. At this point, we'll turn it back over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
I wanted to start, and maybe I missed it. And I appreciate that nice turbo run through of the quarter, nice and compact. I just want to ask about the Expeditionary margins and what's happening there. The C-40 is not there, right? That's in aviation services?
John Holmes:
Yes, that's correct. The C-40 is in aviation services. And Expeditionary, we saw margin compression year-over-year, primarily due to product mix and what was shipped in the quarter. But we also saw an increase in raw material costs for our manufacturing business up in mobility, and that had an adverse impact on the margins in that business.
Robert Spingarn:
So, when we think about the year, I don't know maybe this is for Sean. How -- what do those margins do within your -- what's contemplated in your guide for the next three quarters?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. I think we haven't gone into the specifics on that, but I think for the balance of the year, we would expect some recovery in the margins, and then in the back end of the year to have kind of a strong year and get back to where it was close to the last year.
Robert Spingarn:
And then just on the outsized growth, if I could call it that in Aviation Services, obviously, quite good in the mid higher teens there, could we maybe talk about that or deconstruct that a little bit into parts supply, which sounds like it's a real growth area for you versus the traditional businesses. Is that the right way to think about this, and these more aggressive contract acquisition, and perhaps talk about how that drives the growth, going forward, in aviation?
John Holmes:
So, the growth came from a lot of areas in the company. And again, we were really excited about the strong start to the year. Parts supply, as we've talked about in the last several quarters, has really performed exceptionally well, and that's both parts supply in the aftermarket business, the trading business, as well as parts supply in the new parts business, the distribution business. And we've announced a number of contracts, including two that we just referenced with Mitsubishi, as well as with Leach in those businesses, new and aftermarket parts. And we've announced a number of contracts over the last several quarters. And so those contracts, they take a little while to ramp up, but once they do they really contribute, so that's been -- that's been driving a lot of growth. Also in the quarter, we had a very nice improvement in our MRO business. Last year, if you recall, our summer was particularly slow, which led to a number of issues that we then felt throughout the year as we look to go back into the labor markets to get technicians back on board. We had a very nice recovery in this summer, and that was a real nice contributor to the growth, and that also sets us up well for the balance of the year because if we think about where we were a year ago at this point in time, we're in the market recruiting for lots of technicians, because we're coming off of the soft summer. Given the fact that we've had a stronger summer, our demands for technicians at this point are much less than they were a year ago. So, we're set up well there. And then as Sean mentioned, the C-40 win, we’re in early days of that contract, and it's not -- we don't have a full picture yet on how that revenue will pace quarter-to-quarter throughout the next two years. But as Sean said, we recognized about $18 million in the quarter, this quarter, and that obviously contributed to the revenue growth as well.
Robert Spingarn:
So, if all-in, that's about a $70 million plus increase, $18 million of it is C-40. The other 50-odd million, if I wanted to think about parts supply versus kind of the core business, because the part supply is growing, if I understand correctly, from a very small base. So, everything you add Leach and so forth, is meaningful?
John Holmes:
No, I wouldn't -- we don't want to get into specific growth of the specific operating units, but parts supply is not growing off of a small base. It's a meaningful base and it's been meaningful growth on a meaningful base for several quarters now.
Robert Spingarn:
So, anything we can say about that other 50-odd million, whether it's MRO, parts supply. How do we think about that?
John Holmes:
No, again, I don't think we want to get into details on that, on that element of it, but I would reiterate that we saw a very nice recovery in MRO, and we continue to see parts supply in both new and aftermarket do extremely well.
Robert Spingarn:
Last thing is in the past or last quarter, we didn't talk so much about cash flow guidance because of the investment in new opportunities like parts supply, does that continue to be the case, you're not done at this point of the year?
John Holmes:
It does and we'll note that we did see, as Sean mentioned, we did see a nice improvement in cash flow. We were still consumers of cash this quarter. We consumed about $30 million in cash. But if you take out the impact of the accounts receivable securitization, that's a $20 million improvement over last year. Seasonally, we do see cash consumption in the first quarter largely as a result of MRO. But we are very focused on cash generation, and we expect to see improved cash generation as we move throughout the year similar to what we did last year. But again, relative to guidance, we want to give ourselves the space. The demand for parts in the aftermarket is extremely strong right now, and one of our most significant differentiators is our ability to move quickly and close on large buys of material. And so, we want to give ourselves the flexibility to do that. And then your point on distribution is right on. When you win these distribution contracts, typically there is an upfront buy material and that cash goes out, and as I said before, it does take a little while for those programs to ramp up. But once they do, they become nice contributors to margin as well as turn cash flow positive.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.
Joseph DeNardi:
John to the extent that the labor market and MRO is driven by supply growth; I mean, this year domestic airline supply has probably grown 3%; next year, it's probably going to grow closer to 7% with the MAX coming back. So why shouldn't there be kind of additional strain, again, put on the labor market next year as the growth rate accelerates? Or do you think you've kind of properly de-risked that portion of the business for the foreseeable future?
John Holmes:
I think, we've done a nice job in de-risking and I think your points are right on. The macro environment has not improved for what we do. But we've been, as we talked about throughout last year, very aggressive in terms of the kinds of things that we're doing to get out ahead of labor market. And a lot of that is developing proprietary relationships with tech schools, et cetera, so that we can develop our own pipeline of talent and that is working. There's an additional ramp up there, because that allows you to get fresh talent in the door, and we're seeing some success there, which contributed to the results this quarter and will contribute throughout the year. But with that fresh talent, there is a bit of a learning curve when you get them in. And that learning curve translates to increased productivity in the hangar. So we've got a good team in place. We're definitely in the market now, because we will have more demand in the second quarter versus the first quarter as we do every year. So we're in the market right now recruiting for talent. But once we get through this quarter, we'll have largely the team in place that will need for the year to handle the workload that we have. As it relates to growth next year, we do have floor space. So we have, in a few of our facilities, we do have floor space available. And to the extent that we have demand for customers, and I should mention that we're extremely proud of our customer base in MRO. We've got a blue chip customer base. They're extremely supportive of us. They recognize the value of the service that we provide. They worked very closely with us throughout the summer to keep us fuller in the hangers and they did last year, so that we wouldn't have the labor challenges in the rest of the years as we saw last year. And a lot of them that did that are actually Max operators. So even though they were under significant pressure to have the fleet -- their fleet working harder, they were still able to support us by keeping us fuller during the summer when they needed the aircraft. So thinking about next year, to the extent that we see demand for the customer base that we have and we can layer in additional lines of maintenance, we're certainly going to continue to extend these recruiting techniques that we've been working to meet additional demand in the hangers that we have available floor space.
Joseph DeNardi:
And then just in terms of kind of the pipeline of good sized opportunities, I mean, just given what you booked recently. Are there similar bigger type opportunities out there that you're targeting in the nearest term?
John Holmes:
So I would say that the pipeline and we gave a little -- we gave some numbers on that back in July at the Investor Day. I would say that that pipeline is as strong as it was when we talked about it back in Investor Day. And there are definitely meaningful opportunities out there, particularly on the government side that could have positive impacts in the way that C-40 will. But the challenge for the government business is it's difficult to predict when those are going to occur. So to say that we've got opportunities in the near-term, yes, there are plenty that could hit anytime now. There are bids that have been out there for a while, but it's difficult to predict when those will happen.
Joseph DeNardi:
And then, Sean, just on the M&A pipeline, if you could just kind of maybe talk about that, qualitatively what it looks like if it's changed at all over the past quarter or two, and whether the opportunities are more on the commercial or defense side of the business? Thank you.
Sean Gillen:
Yes. I'd say the pipeline continues to be pretty active but consistent with what it's been, at least the last couple quarters. There's some assets in market. There's some assets that we think are interesting that could be coming to market. And I'd say the split is pretty balanced between commercial and government. I think we see the opportunity to add to both parts of our business. And as we've talked about at the Investor Day, we're really looking to add IP to the business, whether it'd be in kind of the part supply distribution business, or enhancing some capabilities on the government side. So I'd say it's active and pretty well balanced across the portfolio.
Operator:
Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with Canaccord.
Ken Herbert:
John, I just wanted to first again follow-up on the MRO business. Did you hit the inflection you talked about, and was that business profitable for the fiscal first quarter?
John Holmes:
Yes and yes. And as it relates to inflection, it was a big improvement in the first quarter versus last quarter. And that improvement is not only important as it relates to the results for the quarter itself but as I mentioned earlier, it sets us up well for the rest of the year. Being able to maintain that team throughout the summer and being in the market now. And we're still in the market for mechanics as we enter the busy season here, but we're in the market for a lot fewer than we were last year. So we're in an important time right now as we go out there and recruit. We're very encouraged by the results that we're seeing and even as we start the second quarter. And yes, I think we're off to a very good start.
Ken Herbert:
And as I look, there's a lot of growing or lot of speculation that with the MAX returning to service at some point in the next period of time here and with what's happened with narrow bodies and new deliveries, there's going to be a real step up in retirements maybe in calendar '20 and into '21. And I know that generates puts and takes in your business when I think about certainly the parts trading and maybe some lower demand for some of the new material perhaps on the distribution side. But can you just talk about how we should think about that if there is a step up from retirements and the impact on the various pieces of Aviation Services, whether it'd be sort of a net positive or where the risks might be?
John Holmes:
Yes, I think that's a great question and we're certainly thinking about that dynamic. I think overall, we would characterize it as a net positive because today there is, particularly on the aftermarket part supply around engines, there is considerably more demand and more demand forecasted for the next several years for current generation 737 shop business. And to the extent that we're able to get more material, and we will be able to get more material as we see more retirements in that fleet, we've got demand for it. And we're the largest in the world for that market. We've got, as we keep saying, tremendous balance sheet capacity, which we're excited about, and want to maintain. And our goal would be to be in a position where we can move quickly as material becomes available, and we've got outlets for that material. So that's the biggest driver of all of this. Our heavy maintenance contracts are for that fleet, they're longer term and they carry us several years out, so we feel good about the planned maintenance business there. But generally speaking, I would say that we view that as a net positive.
Ken Herbert:
And then if I could just finally and maybe I don't expect you to get too specific on this. But as I think about your comments around parts supply and the very strong demand for material today, both new material through distribution and of course maybe alternative material through the parts trading side. It seems like it's clearly a favorable environment from a pricing standpoint. And I'm just wondering if you can disaggregate a little bit some of the trends you're seeing on pricing within parts supply versus volume? And maybe even just, if you're seeing any changes sequentially or you're getting better pricing sequentially without maybe giving more specifics as to how the growth breaks out. But any color around the price versus volume and trends you're seeing would be very helpful.
John Holmes:
I wouldn't want to get -- and you got it. I wouldn't want to get too specific, just for competitive reasons. But given the tightness of availability of material in the market, you definitely have had some pricing favorability out there, and you've also seen that in terms of the price that you pay for assets. And that, again, is where we believe we excel is our ability to find material, make the buy right, which often comes down to speed of being able to close transactions and then command the best price and availability that you can in the market. So in terms of trends, that's, we've seen that over the last several quarters, this quarter in particular, I don't know that we saw necessarily any sort of meaningful change from where we were in Q3 and Q4. And I don't know that we necessarily see a change in the near-term there as well.
Ken Herbert:
And just one final clarification within trading as I think about your agreement say with Delta and other large customers. What percentage of your trading business do you sell into sort of your long-term contracts versus sort of spot market, or book and ship, if I think about it that way?
John Holmes:
I don't know that we want to get into that specific. But what I can tell you is that it's been a focus of ours to increase the amount of business under contract in the in the trading business. And so that's a much greater percentage of that business than it was a few years ago. But I wouldn't want to get into specifics there.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust. Your line is open.
George Herbert:
Good afternoon, John and Sean, great quarter. This is George on for Mike. You talked a lot about the three major things ongoing, kind of the three mega trends, the 737, what's going on with the DoD. And we seem to have a lot of airline pressure. I guess, I wanted to start my questions with what was announced last week. It looks like we're going to have entire retirement of squadrons out of the Air Force, a $25 billion cut into the budget. Do you have any opinion on what kind of impact that has on AAR, positives, negatives at all?
John Holmes:
We don't have a strong view on that at the moment. For the contracts that we are on and for the contracts that we planned are bidding, none of that would have an impact anything that we're looking at. What we can say is that we think that AAR Solutions for the government and the C-40 is really an outstanding example of this. If the government is looking to save money, going after solutions like what we just offer with the C-40 is a wonderful opportunity for them. And as we mentioned, that's a situation where the government came out. They wanted to buy two aircrafts. They were planning to buy new aircraft. AAR was able to present a solution that allowed them to buy used aircraft and actually get those delivered sooner than they would have if they'd bought new aircraft for considerably less. And you can bet that we're going to take that example and market it all over the place to the U.S. government as an opportunity for them to save money, and not just in whole aircraft purchases. And we believe that there's more out there like this, but also as it relates to just new serviceable material as a source of savings in all areas of procurement. So that's a big part of our strategy.
George Herbert:
And were there any PBL opportunities with the sale of the aircraft in terms of the maintenance also? Or was that not offered as you pursued the C-40 opportunity?
John Holmes:
That's a great question. It was not offered in this particular case. But I will point out that we do have another C-40 contract with the Navy, where we perform the maintenance and certain supply chain services as well. So while it wasn't part of this transaction, it's something that we've done successfully elsewhere.
George Herbert:
Yes, it sounds very exciting. It almost seems like the cost reduction focuses are a tailwind for AAR. Would you characterize it that way?
John Holmes:
Yes, I would. I would.
George Herbert:
Would you say that that also applies with the pressure that we're seeing with the airlines right now? We've had, I think, a slew of airline bankruptcies, and -- in the last 30 days. Is that also an emerging tailwind for AAR?
John Holmes:
We certainly are keeping our eye on that and the credit worthiness of our customers. And obviously, there's been some news just in the last few days in a couple of airlines. So that's definitely something we're focused on. I am in touch with our customers almost every day and often at very senior levels. And while, they're seeing -- and as I think about North America, in particular, while they definitely seeing pressure in certain areas, their businesses are still historically extremely strong. And the day-to-day demand, both for parts and for maintenance out of the customers, is also very strong. Coming back to your point, I do think, yes, as our customers look for more cost effective solutions versus buying from OEMs or other suppliers, the aftermarket solutions that AAR offers represent a great opportunity to get quality products and services at better cost.
George Herbert:
Just going to, Leach, on the electronic power side. Is this your first distribution agreement in this kind of product set, or do you service others products like this with other companies?
John Holmes:
Again, great question. There's a few firsts with this deal. Most notably, this is actually the first where we are distributing parts that will be used in new OEM manufacturing. So we've kind of moved one step up in the supply chain here, where we're distributing parts that will actually be -- where the customer base is not end users like the airlines or the government, the customer base is, actually in this case, the majority of the customer base is going to be OEMs that use the parts in their own manufacturing process. So that opens doors for us and we're excited about that. We've already started ramping up nicely on that contract, and it should bring with it other opportunities as well.
George Herbert:
So would you expect that then to expand with other TransDigm subsidiaries, or would that -- is that in the in the cards do you think?
John Holmes:
Well, I certainly would hope so. TransDigm, as you know with their operating model, they are fairly decentralized. So the subsidiaries make their own decisions. But certainly, we're focused on being successful with the contract we just signed with Leach. And we would do the best we can to leverage that success with other companies like Leach and certainly other companies within the TransDigm group.
George Herbert:
Just wrapping up, adjusted EBITDA margin -- adjusted EBITDA guidance still in the 165 to 170 range?
Sean Gillen:
No. So we didn't give adjusted EBITDA guidance for this year. Guidance for the year is sales, EPS, and we gave some color on SG&A effects.
George Herbert:
I think that is it. And I'll look forward to hearing about your next military acquisition.
John Holmes:
Okay, all right. Thank you.
Operator:
We have a follow-up question from Robert Spingarn. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
I just wanted to ask about the SG&A guide, the 10.5% and whether or not that contemplates any more of these non-GAAP costs. In other words, what you saw in the first quarter?
Sean Gillen:
So the 10.5% would exclude any of those compliance and investigation costs.
Operator:
Thank you. I am showing no further questions in the queue.
John Holmes:
Okay. Well, with that, we really want to thank everybody for the participation in the call and your time and interest in AAR. Thank you.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR’s Fiscal 2019 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Sean Gillen, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company’s Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018. In providing a forward-looking statement, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR’s President and CEO, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Hey, thank you very much and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased to be here to discuss our Q4 and full-year 2019 results. Our sales for the full-year were up 17% from $1.75 billion to $2.05 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 36% from $1.73 per share to $2.36 per share. In Q4, consolidated sales grew significantly, up 19% to a record of $563 million. Our growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was even stronger, up 33% from $0.48 a share to $0.64 per share. Additionally, we had solid cash generation again this quarter as we delivered $44 million of operating cash flow from continuing operations. We continue to see outstanding performance from our parts supply and government programs activities. In MRO, we saw another quarter of sequential improvement. This improvement was driven by actions we have taken throughout FY 2019 to address the tight labor supply, such as enhancing our recruiting efforts, partnering with various schools and repositioning elements of our workforce across our network. Our customers have also continued to work with us to increase pricing, which has partially offset higher labor cost. During FY 2019, we focused on implementing a number of new programs, as well as executing on certain strategic initiatives. Our government programs team successfully implemented both our U.S. Air Force landing gear PBL contract, as well as the WASS INL program. Both programs were extremely large and complex implementations, involving almost 1000 new employees and contractors. We are very pleased with the results of these implementations, and more importantly, so are our customers. As part of our previously communicated strategy to shift to an asset-light GOCO business model, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain assets in our COCO business. In addition to executing on these and other prior awards, we announced several new business wins throughout the year. Most recently, in the fourth quarter, we announced the extension of our engine support contract with MTU. We also received certification from the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau, the JCAB, that will expand our Japanese customer base and further strengthen the company’s position in Asia. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we announced an exclusive distribution arrangement with Woodward to support the U.S. military and a joint repair management contract with Global Aerospace Logistics, or GAL, focused on UAE military fleets. We feel very good about what we have accomplished in FY 2019 and are particularly pleased with our record fourth quarter results. With that, I’ll turn the call over to our CFO, Sean Gillen.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. Before I comment on the financial results, I would like to mention the 8-K we filed this afternoon. As noted, the company retained outside counsel to investigate possible violations of the company’s Code of Conduct, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other applicable laws, relating to the company’s activities in Nepal and South Africa. Based on these investigations, we self-reported these matters to the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the UK Serious Fraud Office. We will fully cooperate in any review by these agencies, although we are unable at this time to predict what action, if any, they may take. Given that this is now an open matter with the government, we will not be able to offer further detail at this time. With that, I will discuss the company’s Q4 and full-year 2019 financial performance in more detail. Our sales in the quarter of $562.7 million were up 19%, or $89.2 million year-over-year. We experienced growth in both segments, including a $78.2 million, or 18% increase in Aviation Services revenues and $11 million, or 37% increase in Expeditionary Services revenues. This significant increase in top line growth was primarily driven by sales in our parts supply activities along with the WASS program. Gross profit increased 11.8%, or $10 million to $94.7 million. Gross margin was 16.8% versus 17.9% in the prior year period, primarily due to the labor challenges in MRO and mix in Expeditionary Services. SG&A expenses were 11.2% of sales versus 13.1% in the prior period, which reflects the utilization of our existing infrastructure to support WASS as well as other growth. However, increased legal cost in the quarter did drive SG&A higher than initially expected. Fourth quarter reported results include tax benefits related to reversals of state valuation allowances, which reduced income tax expense by $5.1 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $22.3 million, or $0.64 per diluted share. This compares to $16.7 million, or $0.48 per diluted share in the prior year. Note that Q4 adjusted income from continuing operations and diluted EPS exclude the aforementioned state tax benefits. Additionally, full-year adjusted results exclude these Q4 state tax benefits, as well as the Q3 federal tax benefits discussed on the previous call. This change in presentation is to more clearly reflect the underlying performance of the business. As John mentioned, in the quarter, we took action to reposition certain elements of the workforce across our network. We incurred after-tax costs of $0.7 million associated with these actions, which we have excluded from our adjusted results. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.1 million and depreciation and amortization was $11.5 million. Net interest expense was $2.1 million, compared to $2.2 million last year. During the quarter, our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $44.1 million, which is net of a $13.3 million reduction in our AAR program. Also, we repurchased 291,000 shares for $9.5 million. Switching to full-year results. Our sales for the full-year were $2.05 billion, up 17.4%, or $304 million year-over-year. Aviation Services sales grew 17.4%, or $285 million. Our sales increases were driven by our parts supply activities, as well as government programs. Expeditionary Services sales grew 16.6%, or $19 million due to volume growth for our mobility products. Gross profit for the year increased 11.8%, or $35 million to $330 million. Gross profit in Aviation Services increased 13.8%, or $38 million, primarily due to parts supply and government programs sales flow-through. Gross profit in Expeditionary Services declined 16.1%, or $3.1 million due to changes in product mix. SG&A expenses were 10.5% of sales versus 11.9% in the prior period. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $83.1 million, or $2.36 per diluted share, compared to $60.6 million, or $1.73 per diluted share in the prior year. Capital expenditures for the full-year were $17.4 million, depreciation and amortization were $42.8 million. Net interest expense for the year was $8.5 million, compared to $7.9 million last year due to an average increase in the underlying interest rate. We feel very good about the strength of the balance sheet and the strong cash flow generation. Net debt decreased $26.2 million to $121.6 million, resulting in net leverage of 0.7 times. Additionally, we returned $20.8 million to our shareholders through dividends of $10.5 million and share repurchases of $10.3 million. I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Thank you, Sean. As we enter FY 2020, we are really excited about the opportunities ahead of us and the outlook for all of our businesses. As indicated in our release, we are providing FY 2020 guidance for sales to be between $2.1 million and $2.2 billion, which represents a growth rate of 5% at the midpoint. We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.45 a share to $2.65 a share, which represents a growth rate of 8% at the midpoint of the range. As part of this guidance, we expect SG&A to be approximately 10.5% of sales and having an effective tax rate of 24%. This guidance reflects continued growth in our parts supply business, which is coming off of a very strong year, a partial recovery in MRO and growth in programs that reflects the full ramp of contracts that had already occurred in FY 2019. Regarding WASS, while we have added a new site and anticipate adding more sites, we expect the financial performance and operational tempo of the WASS program to be consistent with last year. Our estimate for SG&A as a percentage of sales reflects anticipated investments to support the growth of our business, including sales, quality, compliance and IT resources. Regarding the effective tax rate, we want to note that last year’s effective tax rate adjusted for one-time items in Q3 and Q4 was 18.5%, which compares to an anticipated tax rate of 24% for FY 2020. Overall, we are very excited as we enter FY 2020. Our markets are strong. We have robust pipeline of opportunities and we have significant liquidity to fund our growth. We look forward to discussing all of this in more detail at our Investor Day next week in New York on July 17. At this point, I’ll turn it back over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
Good afternoon, everybody.
John Holmes:
Hey, Rob, how are you?
Robert Spingarn:
I’m good. Thanks. And nice numbers from you guys. I wanted to ask you, John, to talk a little bit more about some of the strength in the quarter, particularly Expeditionary, it sounds like program is coming online. And is that sort of a one or two quarter event then it moderates? And then if you could then extrapolate into next year and maybe a little bit further color on the relative business lines, it sounds like MRO’s low single-digit growth and other things are above that 5% rate?
John Holmes:
Yes, sure. Just on the quarter – thanks. We’re really happy with the way the year ended, very strong results from the businesses across the company. As it relates to Expeditionary Services, we’ve announced a few wins in the mobility business throughout the year and we’re starting to perform on those wins and produce and ship our products. So, we saw the benefit of that in Q4. And [when it’s due in] [ph] quarters, we expect to see additional benefit as we ship off against those wins. Thinking about the year ahead, MRO, as I mentioned, we expect a partial recovery. We’re encouraged by the results that we’re seeing both in terms of the labor attraction and retention, as a result of the initiatives that we implemented throughout the year. And we also feel good about the loading in the hangars heading into this year, as well. And you’re right. I mean, as you think about the growth rate at the midpoint of 5%, certain businesses are above that, certain businesses are below that, but that represents our best view of the blended rate from where we sit today.
Robert Spingarn:
John, before you go further, how do we factor India into this MRO outlook?
John Holmes:
Yes. Our India JV, I think, we indicated last quarter that, we expected construction to be complete this calendar year. Based on what we know right now, we still look for that. We’re working to finalize the agreement with the customer. And once all that’s done, we’ll be able to give more color on how that will play into the results.
Robert Spingarn:
Is there any revenue from that joint venture in the guide?
John Holmes:
No, we’re not anticipating any.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Okay. Just with regard to the EPS guidance that the 10 – is the 10.5% SG&A maybe a little higher than you originally expected. Is there anything there maybe tied to this legal situation? We thought it might have been closer to 10%?
John Holmes:
Yes. It is a little higher than we anticipated. As it relates to the matter that Sean mentioned in the 8-K, we haven’t factored in costs there. Although we did see some cost that came through in the fourth quarter. The 10.5% is really based on investments that we’re making around sales resources to promote the continued growth, particularly in the parts businesses, and then we are adding some IT resources. We’re making a number of investments around the digital space and we saw some nice returns from those investments in FY 2019. So we want to continue to fund that growth, and then additional quality and compliance resources as well.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then just to finish up, Sean, on the cash flow for this coming year, how should we think about either operating cash or free cash, especially off of what looked like a bit of an inventory build in this past year?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. We do expect for this upcoming year to have a nice cash flow year to be cash flow positive. But we’re not giving any specific guidance as it relates to either free cash flow or operating cash flow for this upcoming year.
Robert Spingarn:
What are the moving pieces that prevent you from doing that?
Sean Gillen:
I’d say just – the part of our business if we’re going to – if we see opportunity, which we think will continue to do so to invest either support parts supply in inventory or new business wins in distribution or other programs, we’re going to do that. And so we don’t want to limit our ability to grow the business by boxing ourself in our cash flow.
Robert Spingarn:
So you can’t even provide a range, a conversion range?
Sean Gillen:
We’re not providing any guidance on cash flow.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. All right. Thank you, guys.
John Holmes:
Other than to say, we expect to be cash flow positive this year.
Sean Gillen:
Yes.
John Holmes:
Yes.
Robert Spingarn:
Right.
John Holmes:
Right.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Larry Solow:
Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Could you – I’m not sure, if you can maybe give us a little more granularity just on the Aviation Services, the 18% growth, maybe just help parse this out? Is the WASS contract sort of similar sequentially that’s been running out like $50 million plus or minus top line? Is that fair to say?
John Holmes:
Yes, that’s a fair range. Yes.
Larry Solow:
Right. So excluding that, you had essentially low double-digit, it looks like growth. And MRO itself in the quarter, was that actually – it sounds like you recovered sequentially. Was it still down year-over-year?
John Holmes:
It was down year-over-year, but we did see sequential improvement.
Larry Solow:
Got it. And for next year, you’re looking to continue sequential improvement and a little bit, I guess, of growth for the full-year basis on MRO you said, right?
John Holmes:
That’s correct. That’s correct.
Larry Solow:
And then on the Expeditionary side and obviously a nice bump up sequentially and year-over-year. And on the margin basis, a little bit of an improvement, I guess, sequentially. How come – I guess, the pressure year-over-year, is that also labor-related? And considering, expeditionary is predominantly mobility, which I know historically had been a very high-margin business, but I realize some high fixed costs in there. So I would think that with a pretty good bump up in revenue, your gross margin would improve there. Any thoughts on that?
John Holmes:
Yes. I think you hit on it. A couple of moving parts there. One is labor, and we highlighted that in the third quarter and that continues to be an element impacting the results there going forward. And then also, there is a mix of – there is a mix issue there as it relates to margin on different product lines. And certain of those where we’ve wanted on producing are lower-margin product that you might – we might have otherwise seen.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And the [indiscernible] agreement to sell the COCO assets, I know, I think you had announced that last quarter. So is that still sort of set to close sometime in calendar 2019? Is there – any update on that, or…?
John Holmes:
Yes, that’s correct.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And then on the WASS, as we look out, you said sort of similar to this year, or do we get incremental growth from Costa Rica and potentially additional sites, so are you…?
John Holmes:
Yes. We – yes, good question. We are expecting similar performance in FY 2020 to what we saw in FY 2019. And as we’ve been on the program now, we – we’ve learned more about how it operates. And we added a new site. We anticipate adding more sites. But new sites does not necessarily correlate with growth of the program, as you do have some up and downs between sites throughout the year.
Larry Solow:
Okay. I mean, in the long run, would you expect to add more sites that you would get some growth, or I mean, does that necessarily – I would think that would equate with growth over the long run?
John Holmes:
Again, if you look historically, still the program is in a [historical] [ph] low from where it was a few years ago. And so we believe that there’s potential for the program to grow from where it is. But as we look out over the next 12 months just based on what we see, we expect it to be consistent with the prior 12 months.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And then just lastly, just a follow-up to Rob’s question on the SG&A, because I know long-term, you had sort of this, like 10% goal. It looked like we were sort of getting close to that, maybe looks like, obviously, perhaps a little bit of a reset expectation there for some required investments. Would you view some of this stuff as one-time in nature? Is that a recurring type thing? How should we kind of anyway to sort of parcel that out?
John Holmes:
Yes. I mean, based on some investments that we’re making, that’s what’s driving the 10.5% that we’re forecasting for this year.
Larry Solow:
Right.
John Holmes:
But it is still a long-term goal to get to the 10% or below level and we did make meaningful progress. So if you look at where we were last year to this year, we made some really nice progress towards that long-term 10% goal. But given some of these resources that we want to bring on during the year, that puts us at the 10.5% estimate now.
Larry Solow:
And that doesn’t really – you’re not taking into account or will you sort of call that out on – in legal expenses, or…?
John Holmes:
Yes. To the extent, we see legal expenses related to the item in the 8-K. We would – we’ll call that out.
Larry Solow:
And was there any that you mentioned I know in the prepared remarks, there was some of that already in Q4 and not significantly elevated to where you need to call it out, or…?
John Holmes:
There was – there were expenses related to that in Q4.
Larry Solow:
But that’s in your operating numbers, right, you left that in there?
John Holmes:
It’s left in there. We did not call it out.
Larry Solow:
Okay. But potentially next year maybe you don’t pull it out, but at least you might be able to call it out. Is that fair to say?
John Holmes:
Yes. We want to see how it goes, but…
Larry Solow:
Right.
John Holmes:
…likely we’ll highlight that.
Larry Solow:
Fair enough. Great. Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert of Canaccord. Your line is open.
John Holmes:
Hey, Ken.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions]
Ken Herbert:
Yes. Hi, good afternoon, John and Sean.
John Holmes:
Hi, Ken.
Ken Herbert:
Hey, I just wanted to follow-up on the guidance for fiscal 2020 on the top line. Are you seeing specifically within the parts supply side, it looks like maybe growth slows there a little bit. And I’m just wondering, within distribution and purchase trading, are you seeing any sort of sequential shift in those markets, or is it really just up against some very difficult comps from fiscal 2019?
John Holmes:
I think it’s the latter. Yes, we had, as we’ve highlighted throughout the year, we had really substantial growth throughout FY 2019 in both the trading business as well as the new parts distribution business and we’re very pleased with that. We anticipate more growth in both of those business and we’re really happy with our market position in each one of those. But you’re absolutely right. You get up against some pretty significant comps as you go throughout the year.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. And if I could on the trading side, I mean, we all follow, retirements are down pretty significantly, which is maybe lowering your access to some material, but probably more than offset by better pricing. Just can you talk a little bit more, John, about some of the dynamics you’re seeing in that market? And how with retirements and access to material, how we should think about maybe some of the changes or dynamics of that market here into fiscal 2020?
John Holmes:
I think, that’s a great question. And I think you highlighted the two most important elements there. Retirements are down in certain areas. The material availability is tight, but you’re able to make up for that in price. And we have a market-leading position in the aftermarket parts business. And our team has done an exceptional job over the last several quarters dealing with that tight market and really outmaneuvering our competition to get our hands on the best material when it becomes available and that’s come through in the results. And we feel very good about our position there. We feel very good about the availability of materials that we believe will be able to get our hands on versus our competitors. And really, I think, for our ground game is a lot better there. And even in a tight market, we’re able to get the best stuff and sell it at a premium.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. No, that’s helpful. And just finally, as I think about the balance sheet and leveraging, you’re obviously, you could argue underlevered and you’ve got plenty of capacity. How should we think about maybe capital allocation this year? And is there anything else you can say or anything in the guidance regarding potential step-up in the buyback and or the M&A pipeline? I know, you’ve continued to invest for organic growth and I know, that’s clearly a priority, which is great.
John Holmes:
Yes.
Ken Herbert:
But how do we think about maybe other changes in allocation moving here, as you’ve got very favorable balance sheet position?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. I think as you highlight, we feel good about the balance sheet and where it is and it gives us flexibility to invest. I think, priority number one, we’re going to continue to invest in the business to grow the business that we have. But as it relates to the capital allocation, after that, you saw some increased repurchase activity in Q4. I think given the balance sheet and cash flow, we’ll continue to look to deploy capital that way to return capital to shareholders. And on M&A, we will – we do see some opportunities out there and some ability for us to add to our portfolio, and we’re going to look to do that over the next year or so.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. Can you just remind us, Sean, what you’ve got left or what’s outstanding on the buyback authorization?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. We got about 230 left on the buyback as the current authorization.
Ken Herbert:
Great All right. Well, thank you very much.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is open.
Joseph DeNardi:
Hey, good evening, everybody.
John Holmes:
How are you?
Joseph DeNardi:
John, when you look back at your kind of tenure at AAR and the MRO business, what’s the range of margins that that businesses has produced over time over a cycle? Where are they now? And it feels like there maybe towards the lower end? And what’s the strategy for improvement there?
John Holmes:
Yes. You’re absolutely right. I mean, there is a cycle, the MRO business and we’ve talked about this –historically is a single-digit margin business. And it ranges from very low-single digits to high-single digits. But you’ve – we’ve definitely seen that. I would characterize us right now at the low-end of that range. We did a lot in FY 2019 to improve that situation, both in terms of getting more price from the customer, as well as launching a whole series of different recruiting efforts and partnerships to develop our own proprietary pipeline of talent. And we’re starting to see the benefits of those now. And we’ve got a market-leading position in MRO. We’ve got a blue chip customer base. We’ve got great facilities, and we’ve got very supportive customers, and everybody in the industry is aware of this tightness of mechanics. And so we’re getting, as I said in the prepared remarks, we’re getting a lot of support, as it relates to pricing to help deal with the tightness and supply. So I’m encouraged by the progress that we made in FYI 2019. I’m encouraged by the sequential improvements that we saw in the fourth quarter. I’m encouraged by the loading in the hangars that we have going into this summer versus where we were a year ago. And so all of those are positive things. So, again, getting back to your original question about the cycle, while we’re at the low-end, these are all favorable results from the initiatives that we started over the last 12 months to move us back to the higher-end of the range.
Joseph DeNardi:
John, is that an area of the business where you’re looking at M&A to maybe get yourselves some better pricing tower?
John Holmes:
We’re looking at a number of different things there more specifically about our own footprint and rationalizing the workforce across that footprint that we took. As we noted in the prepared remarks, we took some steps during the first quarter to do that and we’re seeing the benefit of those things now. But as it relates to M&A, we – we’re always open to ideas and we will continue to look at creative solutions to deal with the overall labor challenge.
Joseph DeNardi:
Okay. And then John, can you just walk us through maybe the pipeline of opportunities that you’re seeing and I hopped on to the call a little late, so apologize if you did this already. But just a pipeline of opportunities on the government business? And if there are any big ones pending? Thank you.
John Holmes:
Yes. For competitive reasons, I wouldn’t disclose the specific bids that we have out there. But what I will say is that, there are some significant bids out there, both that have already been submitted and also those that are in the works. I think it’s important to note that in the guidance, we – while we have a very strong pipeline of government opportunities, these deals take a long time to award and we are anticipating that even if we see some significant awards during the year, it’s likely that implementation wouldn’t occur to have a meaningful impact on the FY 2020 results. And we could talk a little bit more about the pipeline and the type of things that we’re looking at the Investor Day next week.
Joseph DeNardi:
Got it. Thank you very much.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli of SunTrust. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Nice quarter to close out the year here. Maybe just to stay on that topic, John, winning these government deals and having them taking time, I think, you just want a sizable C130 contract for the Afghan Air Force. Should we expect – is that going to be a contributor at all, modest contributor this year, or is that more of a 21 event?
John Holmes:
It’s actually, it’s a recompete. So we’re on that contract today.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Right.
John Holmes:
So we successfully competed to retain that contract. We have that – yes, so we have that – we had – we were confident in our ability to retain it and so that’s included in the guidance.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. And then maybe Sean, just – your first time going through establishing a framework for guidance, maybe could you just give a little color on what maybe you did differently establishing the guidance this year, or did you guys make any philosophical changes to how you establish the guidance? And any color kind of given your prior experiences and what may be brought to the table?
Sean Gillen:
Yes. I’d say, no major shift in kind of how we came about guidance in terms of the planning of the organization and budgeting process for the year. Obviously, we’re giving guidance at a different point in the fiscal year than the previous guidance. So I think that allows us to have a little bit more insight into what we’re seeing over the next 12 months rather than an 18-month period. But other than that, and I think largely consistent with other company has thought about creating its plan and budget and communicating to the Street.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Got it. And then John, just overall, airline customer behavior, I mean, we’re looking, there’s some – there’s definitely been some profit pressure for some of the carriers traffics decelerating. Just in general, what are you seeing from a behavioral standpoint from your customers? And even kind of weaving in, what’s happening with the MAX, presumably that’s creating some more opportunities for you guys? But maybe just if you can just a little bit of color on the overall market conditions and how you’re looking at them, as we wrap up the summer here and get into the fall?
John Holmes:
Yes, I think, overall, and I think about our most transactional businesses where we’re in, day-to-day contact with the customer, notwithstanding those the macro factors that you mentioned, the pace of activity that we’re seeing on a day-to-day basis is as robust as we’ve ever seen. And that – but that’s enhanced by what I said earlier about our market position and the fact that we’re able to get material that others cannot. And as it relates to the MAX, we talked about that in the third quarter. And we’ve seen some shifting in the MRO schedule as a result of the MAX. And we have seen a slight, I’d say increase in parts demand as a result of the MAX, but nothing that really influenced the results, at least, in the fourth quarter. But certainly, that’s something that we’re monitoring closely.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. And then just the last one for me. The labor pressure and you guys talking about pricing and getting support from your customers. I mean, in short, are you guys able to increase your pricing on existing contracts to pass through some of those higher labor rates you might have to be offering out there?
John Holmes:
Yes, we have.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay.
John Holmes:
We have been able to renegotiate. Not – we have not been able to pass dollar for dollar, but we have been able to get some relief.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. And all of your customers have been open to that renegotiation?. I mean, they obviously understand the dynamics in the marketplace. So it sounds like they’re being receptive to that?
John Holmes:
Yes, the customers are being supportive.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. Got it. Got it. All right. Great. Thanks, guys.
John Holmes:
Right. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. At this time, I’d like to turn the call back over to John Holmes for any closing remarks. Sir?
John Holmes:
Again, thank you for your time and interest in the company. We’re really proud of what we accomplished in FY 2019 and very excited about the opportunities ahead of us in FY 2020 and look forward to seeing everybody at the Investor Day next week. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time."

March 19, 2019
Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to AAR's Fiscal Year 2019 Third Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by John Holmes, President and CEO; and Sean Gillen, Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's President and Chief Executive Officer, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you very much and good afternoon. We appreciate you all joining us to discuss our third quarter FY19 results. Before we begin, I would like to welcome Sean Gillen, our new CFO. Sean joined us on January 7, and prior to AAR, he was most recently Vice President and Treasurer of USG Corporation, and had previously spent 10 years in investment banking at Goldman Sachs. We're very pleased to have Sean on the team. Now turning back to the quarter, consolidated sales grew significantly, up 16% from $456 million in the prior period to $530 million in this quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, our growth was even stronger, up 61% from $0.49 to $0.79, inclusive of a $0.19 tax benefit in the quarter. We also had a strong cash generation this quarter as we delivered $58 million of operating cash flow from continuing operations. We continue to see strong performance from our parts supply and program activities; and in parts supply, our strategic investments have enabled us to capitalize on the continued robust parts demand we are currently seeing, and the multiple new distributorships that we have won are contributing to sustained growth. Our programs activities remain strong, most notably with continued solid execution on our WASS contract. As a result, our aviation services segment grew 16% year-over-year. Sales in our expeditionary services segment have also increased 18% due to other recent contract awards. This strong performance was partially offset by labor shortages at our MRO and mobility systems operations. As you know, the labor market across the U.S. is extremely tight and our more labor-intensive activities have struggled to find enough qualified labor to meet the demand from customers. We've been impacted by these labor shortages in MRO during the last several quarters, and while we saw sequential improvement in MRO in Q3, it was not at the level that we had anticipated. In mobility, as we ramped up production and fulfilled recent contract awards, we met with similar labor challenges. We've taken several actions to address these labor shortages but we expect to see continued sequential improvement. We've also been having productive conversations with our MRO customers about sharing these increased labor costs. Subsequent to the quarter we announced a new international site in Costa Rica within the WASS program. This program continues to perform very well and we are happy with this expanded scope. We also announced another contract award for the production of cargo pallets for the U.S. Air Force which will be fulfilled by AAR Mobility Systems. Also subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain contracts and assets of our COCO business. The sale is subject to certain regulatory approvals, and we expect it to close before the end of calendar 2019. In addition, we have entered into separate agreements to sell the majority of our idle assets. In conjunction with these agreements, we recognized a non-cash after-tax impairment charge of $58.5 million in discontinued operations. As you're aware, the rotary-wing and certain fixed-wing markets have remained under significant pressure from ongoing decline and demand from the U.S. Department of Defense as well as an excess supply of aircraft coming from the softness in the offshore oil and gas market. As we exit the COCO business, this will complete our strategic shift from the asset-heavy COCO model to the asset-light GOCO model which will be a focus of our growth going forward. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Sean to discuss the financials in a bit more detail.
Sean Gillen:
Thanks, John. I will take a few minutes to discuss the company's Q3 financial performance in more detail. As John said, our sales in the quarter of $530 million were up 16% year-over-year. Our consolidated gross profit increased 9.9% year-over-year to $85.3 million driven by the Aviation Services segment. Gross margin was 16.1% versus 17.0% in the prior year period, primarily due to the aforementioned labor shortages, as well as the mix in expeditionary services. SG&A expenses were 10.3% of sales during the quarter, compared to 11.7% last year reflecting the improved leverage of our cost structure to support our double-digit sales growth. We anticipate that full year SG&A will be around 10% of sales as previously indicated. Third quarter results included a reduction of income tax expense of $6.5 million or $0.19 per diluted share. This is primarily related to the recognition of previously reserved income tax benefits. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $27.6 million or $0.79 per diluted share inclusive of the $0.19 income tax benefit. This compares to $17.3 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Note that in the prior year quarter, tax benefit of $0.43 per diluted share was excluded from adjusted EPS because it was due to the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act legislation. In this quarter, the tax benefit of $0.19 per diluted share is included in adjusted EPS because it is due to normal course annual tax adjustments. This this is consistent with past practice. Net interest expense for the quarter was $2.4 million compared to $2.2 million in the prior year due to an increase in underlying interest rates. During the quarter, our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $57.6 million compared to $50.3 million in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included a benefit from our accounts receivable financing program of $63 million, while the current quarter included a benefit of $4.3 million. The strong cash flow generation reduced net debt $45 million during the quarter to $150 million, resulting in net leverage of 0.92x. With that, I will now turn the call back to John.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Sean. As we enter the labor market to recruit in January after the holiday flying season, we experienced greater-than-expected difficulty in recruiting experienced labor to meet the strong customer demand in our MRO facilities. While we're seeing a positive impact from the many actions we have taken to address this issue, it is not at the rate that we expected. Based on the impact to Q3 and the expected impact to Q4, I would like to provide an update to our full year 2019 guidance. We expect sales in the range of $2.01 billion to $2.03 billion, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $165 million to $170 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations inclusive of the income tax benefit of $0.19 in the range of $2.50 to $2.57. At the midpoint of these ranges, the updated guidance reflects annual revenue growth of 15.5%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 14.5%, and adjusted EPS growth of almost 42%. Had we not experienced these labor challenges, we would have been well within the original guidance range. I do want to note that this updated guidance assumes no meaningful impact, positive or negative from the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max fleet. As you know, this is a dynamic situation that we are actively monitoring and we are working with our customers closely to assess any changes. While we continue to experience these challenges in our labor intensive businesses, we are exceptionally pleased with the overall growth of the company. Our parts supply and program activities continue to outperform and we are excited by the full pipeline of opportunities that we see both in our commercial and government markets. I'm excited to have Sean on the team and we are working closely looking at our businesses and strategy for the focus on delivering sustainable growth, margin improvement and consistent performance. We are also very well positioned with a strong balance sheet, we can deploy capital to support our growth strategy. Thank you for time and interest in AAR. At this point, I will turn it back to the operator for questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust.
Michael Ciarmoli:
So just on the guidance, just so I am clear; was the tax benefit already contemplated in the $2.50 to $2.80 for the full year?
Sean Gillen :
No. So that tax benefit was not contemplated as part of the original $2.50 to $2.80 guidance.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay, got it. And then just on Costa Rica for the INL WASS contract; can you give us any color of how that -- I guess, first, how that contract has been performing? It seems like there was no disruption from the government shutdown. And maybe what the potential revenue and operating income benefit could be at that additional site as once you guys get that up and running?
John Holmes:
First of all, the contract is performing very well operationally. The customer is extremely happy. We're in regular contact with our counterparts at the State Department, and they are very pleased with the performance. So this new site will go live later in this quarter and will be fully up and running in the first quarter for FY20. And it's -- we have ranges on what the site will do as it relates to revenue, it's not as large as some of the other sites like Afghanistan for example, but it is -- it will certainly be a positive impact to the program. And I think as we said in the last quarter, there are additional sites being contemplated but this is the first one that's been definitized.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Helpful. And then just last one, and I will jump back in the queue. John, can you remind us where you are on the -- there was the protest for the worldwide logistics support services; right before your call started, it looked like Leidos was awarded the contract. Can you just remind us, are you now a part of that team or where do things stand with that program?
John Holmes:
I'm seeing that announcement. There is -- the protest is over, they ended up adding more participants to the IDIQ. There are, I believe, multiple task orders that are out to bid, and we have few bids in on those task orders and we expect to hear at this point any time. I'll get information on Leidos award.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with Canaccord Genuity.
Ken Herbert:
John, I just wondered if you could provide any more detail on the MRO headwinds, and maybe any quantification around what that did in the quarter or maybe how much of a sequential improvement you saw? And then, as part of that, do you expect this to be sort of fully flushed through in fiscal '19 or how is the visibility look on -- specifically the MRO side of the waiver issue?
John Holmes:
So we go in and out of the market and I’d certainly appreciate question. We go in and out of the market at various times during the year, and one of those entry points, if you will, is January after the aircraft come back from the holiday flying season. And so, now that we're in the market and the aircraft are in work, we have good visibility for the rest of FY19 because we don't have another entry and exit point if you go to the market, so that's why we feel comfortable issuing the guidance. As it relates to quantifying the impact, it's significant, and we try to frame that for you just in terms of -- again, had we not had this waiver headwind, we would have been well in that original guidance range that we issued back in January of last year. So, it definitely has been a significant impact to the company.
Ken Herbert:
And can you quantify the INL contribution in the quarter or maybe what was organic growth for the business?
John Holmes:
Yes, we -- I mean, again, we view INL as organic, it's a win, so we view all the growth this quarter as organic growth. And we -- for the first couple of quarters of INL, we had broken that out just to give everybody a sense of the ramp up, but on an going forward basis, it's part of the company, and so we're not going to be breaking that out but it's contributing as expected.
Ken Herbert:
I mean, I know you alluded to this and I know it's early, but I know you certainly have significant exposure to flydubai in particular, another MAX customers on the programs side of business in particular, and I'm sure as well from distribution. I mean, any initial commentary you can provide on conversations with your customers there and are you seeing any disruption to the business yet or is really the adjustment to the guide largely just reflective of the labor issues within mobility in MRO, and you're not seeing anything yet on the programs side?
John Holmes:
Yes, I know. Great question on the MAX. Certainly, we're in -- we have a number of MAX customers around the world as you know. You mentioned, flydubai which is a program customer. The MAX grounding, certainly depending on how long it lasts could really impact the company in a couple of ways. On the potential downside, it would mean that aircraft that we anticipate coming in for maintenance into our hangars, those could fly to the right because those aircraft have now been put into operation or extended their service to fulfill routes that previously had been operated by the MAX. Conversely, the fact that 737NGs current generation 737NGs, current generation A320s might be flown more to make up for routes that previously have been served by the MAX, that's going to drive likely depending on how this goes on, that's going to drive increased parts requirements and those are bread-and-butter fleets for us, so that can be a positive. So it's early, we're in active dialogue with all of our MAX customers, and it’s something we're watching very closely.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn:
Just looking at the labor shortages, is this specifically just a labor shortage or is it a pricing issue? In other words, are you able to get your customers, you've talked about this in the past -- to the pricing level you need in order to compensate the labor?
John Holmes:
The recent activity of the customers as it relates to potential pricing changes in this issue has definitely improved significantly over the last couple of quarters and we've had -- we have had some success for the couple of our major customers in repricing our agreements to account for higher labor cost on our end. However, this is a timing issue, and this is a bit of a moving target. One of the things we saw when we went back into the market in January is that rates that we felt good about, that would attract labor in certain sites actually were not as attractive as we thought. So we ran a bit of back and forth between what it took to get experienced technicians and what it takes too -- and what we are able to get from the customers; so that's an ongoing dialogue. And it's also not just a rate discussion, we -- it's really about the experience of the labor force. So we've been able to attract bodies if you will, good people, but they are just not as experienced and not as efficient as the labor force we would have had say a year ago, and so that efficiency certainly plays a role in the profitability inside the operation as well.
Robert Spingarn:
And then, I wanted to ask you -- because I don't recall you mentioning it but is there any update on India?
John Holmes:
Yes. India is still an ongoing project. We had -- we actually did make quite a bit of progress this past quarter, there were some -- various issues that had slowed down the construction of the facility, we got through those, we're back on-track now, we're still on an active dialogue with the launch customer and I still view that as the calendar 2019 Go Live event.
Robert Spingarn:
And when are you going to be able to give us some kind of -- to quantify that opportunity?
John Holmes:
Overall, it will be -- it's a startup, right, so there will be some startup costs that we'll incur once we get going but ultimately we view this as an accretive operation to the portfolio given the price that we'll be able to charge over there relative to the cost of labor. And as we get closer and certainly as we announce the -- as we're in a position to announce the launch customer, we can provide more information on all that.
Robert Spingarn:
And then just going back to the question; this is another version of the INL question and the growth, but can -- at some level can you parse apart aviation services and give us an idea of how growth differs between parts, programs, MRO, INL so forth? There is so much in there now, clearly, INL is a big driver here because it's new; can we put this to get an idea what everything is doing?
John Holmes:
If we go back to the Q1 and Q2, we had broken that down a bit more and overall, we saw and we -- because we're within the segment, we want to get away from that. But overall, we saw similar performance, similarly, very strong performance in the part fly businesses as we did in the first half of the year. So to go back -- if you go back and you look at what we had disclosed prior, we're kind of in that range, and we could see that continuing, I mean, this is -- those businesses are doing extremely well at the moment and we're encouraged by all of the demand that we're seeing, both in the aftermarket parts market and the new parts distribution market.
Robert Spingarn:
And then how do we think about just to put all this stock on labor shortage and so how do we think about MRO; is it growing?
John Holmes:
MRO has declined from last year.
Robert Spingarn:
And based on what everything you said, the hiring situation and so on; at what point do you expect it to inflect up?
John Holmes:
We're working on that and we are writing our plan, and we're starting to write our plan for FY20. And we will be having an Investor Day at the beginning of FY20 and at that point we'll provide guidance for the full year. And one point just -- Rob, just as you think about aviation services, and we'll talk more about this when we have our Investor Day; we view this as a bundled services offering, so this is a big part of our value proposition and how we're driving growth in the market. It is the part supply related to our parts program related to the MRO, we view all of those is working together to offer a bundled solution to the customer. And as you know, that model has been quite successful if you look at the growth in aviation services over the last several years.
Robert Spingarn:
Sure. But of course, the hallmark of this whole thing is that it's all been growing and the idea was that third-party outsourcing on the labor side would be a trend that continues. And it sounds like you're sticking with that, you've just got this hiccup with the labor but I guess we also wanted to make sure it isn't something structural about third-party?
John Holmes:
No, I don't see it as structural. I think you're exactly right, I think this is a moment in time in the market and we're in the process of finding a new equilibrium between the rates that we charge the customers and the rates that we have to pay in order to feel the qualified team of mechanics.
Robert Spingarn:
And then just to put a finer point on it now that you've told us that MRO contracted; how many quarters has that been the case?
John Holmes:
That's been the case this fiscal year.
Robert Spingarn:
The whole fiscal -- so, all 3 quarters?
John Holmes:
Yes.
Operator:
Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS.
Larry Solow:
Most of my questions actually have been answered but I'll ask a couple in certain different ways. So, on the reduction of the guidance so that the $15 million, $20 million EBITDA you're reducing I guess [ph]. It looks like it's -- I think a couple of questions to that. Is it solely from the labor shortage, so really, exclusively MRO and maybe a tiny bit in mobility or is everything else -- and everything else, for us the business sounds like doing well, that is all sorts of [indiscernible] expectations?
John Holmes:
Yes, Larry, you've got that right. I mean, the -- it's coming from the labor businesses which are the hangars, and mobility is the manufacturing, that's what's driving it.
Larry Solow:
And mobility is still doing pretty well…
John Holmes:
Yes, exactly. I mean, the overall growth of the company is still -- we've still got mid-teens growth and again, the programs businesses and the parts businesses continue to perform well about the expectations that we had.
Larry Solow:
And the outlook for the programs businesses, a lot of them just remind us, obviously adding new program wins is great but a lot of these programs are still sort of not fully ramped, so it seems like there is some visibility on them assuming the environments -- aviation environment [indiscernible], they should ramp further?
John Holmes:
That's correct. Several of our customers that we have contracts with, their fleets will grow and so we'll see additional ramp on business that we've already won. And that's with the programs businesses, we've also over the last couple of quarters continue to sign a number of new parts distribution businesses with different OEMs and those are all in various stages of ramping up as well, and that's another area of the company, the new parts distribution area of the company which is contractual on the buy. In other words, we have contracts -- long-term supply contracts with the OEMs but in a lot of cases, it's also contractual on the sell; in other words, we have long-term supply agreements locked up with the airline customers that we serve or the government customers that we serve. And so that's a nice sustainable growth business that's more easy to forecast.
Larry Solow:
And then on the INL contract, I know you guys -- you rather not quantify and I understand. Is it fair to say it's sort of running in that plus or minus $200 million annualized revenue number?
John Holmes:
It will be a little below that this year. So if you look at the last couple of quarters that we did disclose, we're in the high 40s. So it will be below the $200 million for this fiscal year.
Larry Solow:
And then on Costa Rica, I know -- again, I think this is your sixth site, right? You had five sites already, is that correct [ph]?
John Holmes:
It's the fifth operating site.
Larry Solow:
So there were four sites. So we're out -- is it half the size plus or minus, is that a good way to look at it, they are average of the other four or…
John Holmes:
Yes, we prefer not to get into that but it will not be the largest site.
Larry Solow:
But it's more than a rounding, I mean it sounds like it's double-digit millions in annual sales at least or contribution.
John Holmes:
Fair.
Larry Solow:
Fair enough. How about just a color on proceeds that you expect from -- to share the COCO assets? I guess, maybe we can figure out what you had valued in your balance sheet before and what you wrote off? But -- could you share anything in terms of what you expect from proceeds of that -- is that a material number or not?
John Holmes:
Not yet, we're -- we still have some assets that we're looking to sell. So once that's all wrapped up, we'll disclose those amounts.
Larry Solow:
And then it seems like you've gotten sort of plus for Q4 similar performance, at least in the top line and maybe a little better on the bottom-line, that looks like -- the range is from -- do my math correct?
John Holmes:
Yes, that's right.
Larry Solow:
And then we surely assumes a normalized tax rate is like 24% mid-20s?
John Holmes:
Yes, 23% to 24% is what we think on the tax rate.
Larry Solow:
Just last question; you guys -- I think you announced, you had got some [indiscernible] similarly, the Asia. Could you just help us, I'm sure this is more of a longer term opportunity but actually what that market could be for you guys in say 3 to 5 years or something?
John Holmes:
On the government side we've actually got a lot of good things going on in Japan, we do quite a lot of new parts distribution to the JMOD, the Japanese Ministry of Defense. And we've got -- because of that we have a growing of footprint in Japan in terms of an office there. And we have had contracts with various Japanese commercial customers over the year, having the ability to issue tags on repair parts, attendance to some of these other opportunities that we have in Japan is a positive. So it's a target market for us, the store [ph] has been a really good market for AAR. We saw some -- it kind of ran away from us in recent years but we've had a renewed push and get in the JCAD [ph] approval is a good step in the right direction.
Operator:
Thank you. And our next question, we do have a follow-up from Ken Herbert with Canaccord.
Ken Herbert:
I just wanted to follow-up on -- again, this MRO; I don't mean to keep harping on this but presumably, the business in these airlines are going somewhere and as you've sort of had a bit of a disruption, do you expect any issues at higher prices sort of winning some of this work back or sort of taking share as you're able to bring the talent on? Or I guess, how do we think about that and sort of timing issue or these customers ideally not representing any sort of permanent section but how do we think about that competitive dynamic as we're able to bring the people back on?
John Holmes:
It's important to note that as we've been going through this over the last few quarters, we have not lost a single customer. We have had work or lines of work that we have had to turn away at certain of our facilities because we just didn't have the labor to handle them but the customers, overall, are sticking with us; and not only are they sticking with us, they are very supportive of AAR, we deliver a quality product, we're the largest in North America as you know, and we are a vital part of this part of the aviation aftermarket support system. And so the dialogue that we've been having is one around, ""what do you think you need from us in order to feel the teams so that we can keep the work with you"", and we've received a lot of support in that regard. In terms of where the work is going, there is a number of larger and smaller MROs in North America, that work has been kind of moved around based on things that we've had to turn down depending on where we were in the labor retention area but the customers are supportive. And it's also important to note that we've got -- we do have long-term contracts in place with most of our larger MRO customers and so we've got mechanisms to keep the work.
Ken Herbert:
And I'm assuming most of the work or the lines that you haven't been able to support have been either regional jet or narrow-body aircraft, correct?
John Holmes:
That's correct.
Ken Herbert:
Just one final question; you used to talk at the beginning of the fiscal year around roughly sort of 50% cash conversion on the EBITDA or did it ever take sort of $90-ish million for the full year? I mean, clearly these issues have -- maybe pushed that to the right but can you just provide any update on expectations for the fourth quarter in terms of what is typically a very strong quarter for you in terms of cash generation; how we should think about the fourth quarter or think about the full year conversion if you can sort of update that, that would be great. Thank you.
Sean Gillen:
I think we expect in Q4 as you mentioned is usually a pretty strong quarter for cash flow, so I think we'd expect continued strong cash flow growth in Q4 but as it relates to kind of the full year and that 50% EBITDA target, that's not something that we think we're going to be in but we think we'd be cash flow positive for the year as we've mentioned previously.
Operator:
Thank you. Speakers, I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to you.
John Holmes:
Okay. Well, again, we appreciate everybody's time and interest, and we look forward to wrapping up our fiscal year. Thank you very much.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day."

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to AAR’s Fiscal Year 2019 Second Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by John Holmes, President and CEO and Mike Milligan, Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR’s President and Chief Executive Officer, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Thank you very much and good afternoon. We appreciate you all joining us and we are pleased to share our second quarter FY ‘19 results. During the second quarter, consolidated sales grew significantly, up 17% from $421 million to $493 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased even more significantly, up 51% from $0.39 to $0.59 for the current quarter. The strong performance was driven by continued growth in our trading, distribution and programs activities. Adversely impacting these strong results was the non-cash charge related to the bankruptcy of the European commercial program customer. As you know, 3 years ago, we made a major push in the commercial power-by-the-hour market and have been very successful in winning multiple contracts. This is one of the first agreements we signed as part of this effort and the contract had been underperforming for a period of time and we had worked with the airline to restructure our program. We had agreed to a deal and on the path to recovery, but unfortunately, the airline ceased operations at the end of our quarter. As you all know, we have a comprehensive process for continually monitoring our credit exposure and deferred cost position and outside of this event we are comfortable with the current strength and quality of our portfolio. Elsewhere in the quarter, we continue to see exceptionally strong performance out of our trading, distribution and programs activities. Sales in our Aviation Services segment excluding the impact of the KC-10 program wind down increased 21% year-over-year. We achieved this significant sales growth despite softness in our MRO business, which was primarily due to labor shortages of certain facilities. We have taken a number of actions to address this, including enhanced recruiting, increasing wages and adjusting pricing with our customers. We are starting to see positive results from these initiatives and expect an improvement in MRO in the second half of the year. As you can tell from our release, it was a busy quarter for winning new business. We announced several new agreements, including a new contract with Zodiac Aerospace to deliver its products to global and commercial aerospace customers. This is our first distribution agreement with the unit of the Saffron Group and we are excited about additional growth potential. We also announced a new distribution agreement with Ontic military, a unit BBA Aviation, to distribute electronic parts to military customers. And our trading group signed a new contract with Ameco, which is an engine repair JV between Lufthansa Technik and Air China formed in 1989. We will be providing engine repair and exchange services to Ameco. On the government side, we are awarded a 5-year contract with the U.S. Marshals to provide maintenance and logistical support services for a suite of 737 aircraft. Finally, we announced a new partnership with Napier Park Global Capital to manage late life commercial aircraft. Napier Park is a London-based private equity firm and will be providing the majority of the equity capital for us to pursue late life leasing and trading transaction. We see many opportunities in this market and we are looking forward to leveraging our extensive MRO, leasing and trading experience as part of this new partnership. We are excited by the number of new business wins and the fact that they span so many of our product lines which validates our integrated aftermarket strategy. With that, I would like to turn it over to Mike who will talk about the financials in a bit more detail.
Mike Milligan:
Thanks, John. I will take a few minutes to discuss the company’s Q2 fiscal year ‘19 financial performance in more detail. As John said, our sales in the quarter of $493 million were up 17% year-over-year. Our consolidated gross profit increased 10.7% to $78.3 million driven by gross profit increases in Aviation Services. We are pleased that our SG&A expenses were 10% of sales during the quarter compared to 11.6% last year reflecting the improved leverage of our cost structure to support our double-digit sales growth. Adjusted SG&A expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, severance and restructuring charges, were 9.7% of sales for the quarter compared to 10.9% in the prior year quarter. As John discussed, during the quarter we recognized a $12.4 million pre-tax charge in our Aviation Services segment due to the bankruptcy of a European airline customer. The majority of the charge related to deferred cost that we expected to recover over the remaining term of the contract and the remaining balance was in accounts receivable. In total, across all of our commercial programs, the company is in a deferred credit position meaning we have collective billings in excess of our cost. Notwithstanding this airline failure, we remain highly confident in the quality of our diverse customer base. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $20.8 million or $0.59 per diluted share compared to $13.3 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Our capital expenditures remained low for the quarter at $3.8 million, while depreciation and amortization was $10.4 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $2.4 million compared to $1.8 million in the prior year due to higher average borrowings during the quarter and an increase in our underlying interest rates. While we continue to invest in our organic growth opportunities, we maintained low leverage of 1.2x net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA, strong interest coverage and significant liquidity of more than $300 million of revolver availability plus cash. As previously discussed, we expected to be a net investor in our business unit’s growth during the first half of the year. From the top down, our business units are highly focused on converting these investments into cash and we expect to be significantly cash flow positive during the – both the balance of the year and for the full year overall. With that, I will now turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Thanks Mike. Overall, we feel very good about the progress in the first half of the year and the outlook for our business. As I mentioned earlier, we have continued to experience labor shortages in our MRO business which has negatively impacted our revenue. Even though we expect this to improve in the second half of the year, we are going to adjust our full year revenue guidance from a range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion to range of $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion. While the lower MRO business has been soft, our higher margin trading, distribution and programs businesses have been stronger than expected allowing us to maintain our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.50 a share to $2.80 a share and $180 million to $190 million respectively. Our revised guidance reflects annualized sales growth of 14% to 20% and slightly higher operating margins in our previous guidance. We are very encouraged by the full pipeline of opportunities that we see in both our commercial and government markets. Our balance sheet remains strong. And I am excited about the momentum that we have going into the second half of the year. Thank you for your time and interest in AAR. And at this point, we will turn it back over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
Hey, good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hey, Rob. How are you?
Robert Spingarn:
Hey, John. John, could you talk a little bit about MRO and it seems now the issue was labor before the issue was availability of aircraft to repair. So can we talk about what’s trending up and down and how you think about that going forward?
John Holmes:
Sure. Yes, happy to do that. So, labor has been a consistent theme for a few quarters now and we continue to make moves to address it. You are absolutely right, last quarter we talked a bit about open slots that we needed to fill in the back half of our year. We are happy that we have been able to fill the majority of those slots. We have still got a little bit of work to do at the tail end of the fourth quarter, but we have got a number of opportunities that we are chasing. So, in terms of filling maintenance gaps, that’s looking better. In terms of the labor situation, we continue to have some shortages of the couple of our larger sites. The thing that has – that’s encouraging is the dialogue with our customers. As I mentioned, we’ve been successful in renegotiating two pricing agreements with a couple of our larger customers that certainly is good. And I would say, the overall tone that – with the customers has improved since we first started talking about this over the last couple of quarters. In other words, the market is becoming very aware of this challenge and the customers valuing us as a supplier, valuing the service that we provide. They want to make sure that they’re being good partner to us. So all of that – it’s a pretty, it’s a dynamic situation, but we’re working all these initiatives in parallel and for all those reasons we’re feeling better about the second half.
Robert Spingarn:
Is there any risk of margin compression in instances where the customers are unable to renegotiate with you in order to avoid losing the revenue you just have to deal with the higher like cost labor?
John Holmes:
Yes. We have seen some margin compression and that’s showing up in our gross profit margin. And right now, in many cases we’re dealing with timing, in other words, we’re collecting a certain amount, our real costs have gone up and that’s – it just take some time to work through these agreements with the customers. So we have seen it. I expect we’ll see it here for a little bit, but net-net, the things are trending in the right direction.
Robert Spingarn:
And then just on, you mentioned your move into the late life market. What’s the latest – what are the latest trends in aircraft retirements now especially, now that the narrow body, the new narrow body deliveries are recovering?
John Holmes:
Yes. We’ve been seeing a number of opportunities in late life packages. And we trade in that world is a matter, of course, whole aircraft relatively frequently. What is good about the equity partnership that we signed with Napier is they’ll be providing the majority of equity capital for us to go after larger transaction. I mean, these are transactions that we come across all the time in ordinary course of business and we’re close to that market and we’ve got a – we believe there’s going to be even more of them based on where we are in the cycle, and we expect to see more deals and it’s good to have equity capital alongside of us that we can – that we can pursue those larger transactions without doing it fully with our own balance sheet.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then you spoke to this just a little while ago in the monologue, but in terms of exposure to bankrupt airlines and so on, you said you feel good about where you are with the rest of your portfolio. But are there provisions – just from an accounting perspective, what kind of provisions do you actually have on the balance sheet, in other words, what is your actual true risk if you were to have to write anything else off?
Mike Milligan:
Rob, we – we’ll evaluate those on an ongoing basis, but at this point don’t have any specific concerns that we’ve reserved against. So we feel good about the quality of our customer base at this point in time, and to the extent, that we obviously were working with our airline customer in the past and working to address it, but it was unfortunate that they went through the bankruptcy process.
John Holmes:
We –
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then –
John Holmes:
I think it’s important to know, this is the – Rob, just one more thing, I’ll add, this is the first failure of any significance that we’ve had any meaningful exposure to in at least 10 years. So this is something we pay a lot of attention to as a matter, of course.
Robert Spingarn:
And then just as a final question just – and I know, we already talked about the MRO and the demand that’s out there from the summer and so on. But in terms of the macro, everybody is very focused on the macro environment and the fact that air traffic is maybe slowing just slightly. In your forward planning, are you getting any sense that the macro is affecting market demand at all for MRO type activity or for any – really any of the activity you have in Aviation Services?
John Holmes:
We feel really good about the – we feel – the short answer is, we feel very good about the overall macro trend and we’re still seeing a lot of demand particularly again on the parts, the trading, the distribution, and the program side. We still see demand in MRO. And even if you look at the Aviation Services segment if you were to back out MRO from that, you would have seen that those other businesses trading, distribution, and parts were up 33% year-over-year, that’s exceptionally strong growth in those areas.
Robert Spingarn:
Well, thank you very much. Appreciate the color.
John Holmes:
Sure.
Mike Milligan:
Sure.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Larry Solow:
Thanks. Just a follow-up on that one. So that the 33% growth is – does that exclude the INL contract too?
John Holmes:
No, that’s all programs, that’s all programs.
Larry Solow:
Okay. You’re right. So do you have a number for what INL did, I’m just trying to figure out what your sort of your core business did excluding INL, and the KC-10, I can figure out myself, but just sort of –
John Holmes:
Yes. Sure, sure. So INL did $43 million of sales in the quarter. But I think that it’s important to note that we consider INL core business and –
Larry Solow:
No, no, absolutely. I’m just trying to figure out – go ahead, the – for sure. Sorry, go ahead.
John Holmes:
Larry, we consider INL core business and it’s part of an overall program strategy and there’s several other GOCO opportunities that we’re going to be chasing that are very similar to INL and some of them are quite meaningful in size. And one of the great things about AAR is, we’ve got this mix in our portfolio of government and commercial, and if you looked at the results, you actually saw an increase in the government as a percentage of the sales this quarter. And we’ve got a long-term goal to get that closer to 50% – 50% government, 50% commercial, and again, we view wins like INL as part of that core business. But the short answer to your question is $43 million on INL for the quarter.
Larry Solow:
Yes, absolutely. I didn’t mean to discount, INL was a multi-year effort to win it and a significant – your biggest contract by itself. So just a couple of questions on that. The $43 million I think a little bit, this was the first quarter sort of full ramp there. So we saw full ramp, is that – the number seems a little light, is there some quarterly volatility in that, and how about the underlying profit, is it sort of meeting your expectations?
John Holmes:
Yes, good question. You’re absolutely right. This was our first full quarter of operation in INL. And I might add that it’s going extremely well, it’s going extremely well. And we – what we are learning now that we’ve been on the contract for a few months is that, there is within a period variability in terms of material consumption based on how they operate the aircraft. So that is – as we are learning, we are going to see some variability in revenue. We still believe that overall, it should be viewed as a $200 million a year customer of our account, but we are going to see some variability as it relates to that material spend. From a profitability expectation, it is right in line with our expectations probability wise.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And just touching just to clarify the MRO piece. So I mean, I know that the labor has been ongoing thing for several years and that’s a little – I think demand has been there, it was just sort of a blip last quarter. I was just trying to clarify this quarter, was it sort of – was the demand there, but you just couldn’t meet it because of labor, or you’re not able to sign contracts because – so you have that labor in hand. So how – just sort of, can you parse that out for me?
John Holmes:
I think, yes, I think you’ve got that right. The demand came back this quarter and again across all of our commercial businesses we saw strong demand and expect to see continued strong demand going forward. But you’re absolutely right. We saw demand in certain cases, at certain of our sites we were not able to answer that demand because we couldn’t get the mechanics. And it’s not just about getting the mechanics, it’s about getting the right level of experience to produce again, quality aircraft at the right level of efficiency and that’s a big part of the equation as well.
Larry Solow:
Right. And you mentioned obviously, you see some of your initiatives working and you have two renegotiated contracts, so two large customers, I guess, so that should certainly move the needle, I guess, with your large customers. So you sound fairly confident that you may not be at capacity in the back half of the year, but hopefully getting close to that. Is that a fair statement?
John Holmes:
I mean it’s – we’ll be better in the second half of the year than we are in the first half of the year in MRO.
Larry Solow:
Okay.
John Holmes:
But I think it’s important to reiterate that even with the slowness in MRO, we still have 51% earnings growth and excluding KC-10 wind-down, 21% top-line growth. So again, that should give you a sense for the momentum and the exceptional performance that we’re seeing around the company.
Larry Solow:
Right. And you mentioned a couple of several – it sounds like opportunities on the GOCO side. Could you maybe not specifically share details, but give us any high-level tease or timelines or anything on that note?
John Holmes:
Isn’t large opportunities high-level tease enough.
Larry Solow:
Yes. Well, I mean, you could always say 5 years from now we could – there could be –
John Holmes:
Yes. No, so, we have a couple of bids, significant bids that have been submitted. We have a couple more that we are expecting to see in the way of an RFP. And so the timing on the bids that have been submitted. We are obviously at the mercy of the government here. So, we are hopeful that those will be announced sometime in the first calendar quarter of next year.
Larry Solow:
Okay, great. Obviously, that’s a better piece. And then just last question I realized mobility is obviously a small piece of your business and far from what it was a few years ago, but the margin on the growth side is a little bit down sequentially is there anything to look at?
John Holmes:
Yes. On expeditionary services, the mobility business itself is actually doing quite well. We recently got another – it’s up year-over-year, we recently got some more funding for additional power orders come through which we like to see. The softness there is actually out of our composites operation. There was a program that we had in place at this time last year that has since completed. There are some other new programs that we have won, the start dates have just been delayed. So, that’s what’s showing up in the softness inside expeditionary.
Larry Solow:
Okay, so in between programs on the composite side. Got it. Okay, great. Well said. Thank you.
John Holmes:
Great.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert of Canaccord. Your question please.
John Holmes:
Hey, Ken. How are you doing?
Ken Herbert:
Hey, John. Hey, Mike. Good afternoon. I first just wanted to start out, when you look at the margins within Aviation Services, is that down year-over-year, is that all INL and sort of the impact of that ramp or was there I mean I would have thought the lower mix in terms of less MRO contribution in the quarter would have been more of a perhaps some positive for margins in the segment?
John Holmes:
You are seeing a positive impact at the operating margin, but negative at the gross profit margin that’s predominantly MRO. We just have fixed cost, but we haven’t fully be able to leverage, because we have not been at capacity. INL is a little bit of a factor in there, but the majority of it is because the lower MRO volumes.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, okay. So you are just hitting on the cost and it sounds like again just to revisit this one more time, it sounds like in terms of the scheduling issues that’s maybe bleeds a little bit into this quarter, but is largely wrapped up or is that wrapped up by the end of the fiscal year or is that get wrapped up sooner?
John Holmes:
Yes, it’s – we have filled the gaps through the middle of the fourth quarter. We have got a little bit of work to do at the very tail end of the year, but we have got a number of opportunities that we are looking to close those gaps, but definitely progress has been made since we talked about it last quarter.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, that’s great. And on the distribution business, it sounds like good growth there, is it possible to parse out sort of the organic growth within that business versus new contracts or new….
John Holmes:
I am sorry which business, Ken.
Ken Herbert:
With distribution business, yes, sort of what you are seeing with customers or suppliers you have had for over a year or versus the new customers or suppliers are bringing on which is great growth, but I am just wondering if you can give sort of an apples-to-apples growth in that business?
John Holmes:
Yes, it’s a mix of both. I mean we have had launched some contracts that continue to expand particularly on the government side. We have had – commercial has done very well as well, but we have also seen a nice uptick since the budget has been in place on the government side. And then the deals that we have announced are really just starting to kick in. So if you were thinking about it in terms of same-store sales, we have seen an increase certainly in same-store sales, but some of these deals that we have singed in the last two quarters are now starting to contribute as well.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, that’s great. And then just finally on the programs business, I know you are seeing maybe a little more competition price wise here and – but clearly is a very attractive growth market. Can you just talk about maybe activity levels that you are seeing from airlines now, is the broader pipeline getting significantly bigger or do you feel like it’s maybe stabilizing a bit, just would you talk about sort of bid and quote activity on the programs business?
John Holmes:
Yes, great question. I would say overall it’s been relatively consistent. We have seen some very aggressive pricing out of certain of our competitors. And as you and I have discussed, we have a pretty disciplined approach to these things relative to our return requirements. And certainly when we can hit those return requirements and when the business we do and otherwise we re happy to what it go to other people but that the overall pipeline has been relatively consistent in terms of opportunities over the last couple of years and we’re invited to have a bid process three, four years ago I wouldn’t have been able to say that, but when an airline sends out an RFP, we’re on the list, alphabetically right at the top.
Ken Herbert:
And just one final question can you expand a little bit on the agreement you just recently put in place the joint venture with Napier, it sounds like you’re both may be managing sort of some their assets that are out on lease and then of course having opportunity from an end of life standpoint, but could you just flush that out a little bit for us and then may be if you can provide any sort of bracketing in terms of the potential revenue contribution and how we should think about it?
John Holmes:
Sure. So Napier is it’s as I mentioned it’s a private equity firm that got a multiple billion fund they run actually out of both New York and London and we have partnered with them in the form of a joint venture and they own no aircraft at least in our that are part of the market of the asset types that we’ll be chasing with them they have no existing portfolio so they’re bringing money to the table and as I mentioned it before, we are extremely active in these markets, we see lots of opportunities that come out of less source and airline et cetera, but opportunities that you know candidly will be more significant that we were going to chase with our own balance sheet yes, we’re in the market, we’re very active and therefore we’re seeing them so that led us to go out and seek a financial partner and we found a great one with Napier and so they’ll be providing the majority of the capital, we’ll put in some of our own equity capital and we’ll go out and we’ll buy whole aircraft to trade, potentially aircraft to put on a very short-term lease, but then ultimately trade out of and the target of that is as we mentioned late life aircraft in terms of profitability and revenue, it wouldn’t be right I mean to necessarily comment on that right now, but we’re excited to get going and starting to deploy the capital that we’ve lined up.
Ken Herbert:
Okay it sounds like interesting way to really leverage. What you can bring to the table in terms of the industry expertise, is this something that could theoretically be applied where you could pursue with other entities as well as something that’s scalable or is this really sort of a one-off opportunity?
John Holmes:
Well, it’s the answer is, yes, it’s scalable and I think it’s not only scalable with other parties, but Napier has they’ve got quite a bit more equity capital they’ve allocated an exclusive amount to this particular joint venture which is significant, but there’s more capital behind that just with this partner, they could be available through as we get some success here but yes and then beyond that seeking other partners, I think that’s something that’s potential as well.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, great. Thank you very much.
John Holmes:
Thanks Ken.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of SunTrust. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here.
John Holmes:
Hey, Mike.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey. John, maybe just to stay on that Napier topic, just one final question. How much if at all was fuel and oil price is a factor in sort of Napier’s decision making there, I mean, we’ve seen quite a collapse in oil and fuel prices here making those late life planes a little bit more attractive. Did that factor into sort of this the formation of the JV or this entity at all?
John Holmes:
No, I mean, certainly it was part of the discussion, I wouldn’t say it was a driving factor by any means. We’ve even before oil went up and then came back down again, we’ve been seeing meaningful opportunities over the past year plus, which is what led us to go out to the market and look for a partner, so that we could participate in a more significant way. But certainly, the price of fuel and its impact on the longevity of these late life [sic] assets is, it’s something that we’re considering are a big – as a factor as we go out and do deals.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. And I may have missed it. Are you guys targeting specific planes ? I mean, are these wide-bodies, narrow-bodies, anything presumably more appealing or do you – you’re going after a certain niche there?
John Holmes:
We are – we haven’t disclosed that for competitive reasons, but we’ve got a very, I’d say, defined view of the type of opportunities we want to pursue.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Okay. Most of my other ones have been answered, but just on – on the MRO, I think this was maybe you talked about it as being MRO 30% of total revenues at one point. How big is the MRO supposed to be for this year and I am assuming it’s going to be down year-over-year or did it just not grow enough to meet your expectation? So I guess two questions, maybe the total percentage and will it actually be up year-over-year this year?
John Holmes:
So MRO will be down year-over-year as part and again that’s being offset by tremendous growth elsewhere in the business that we talked about. I think that’s in terms of the percentage right now, I will just – I will leave it at that. And as we go through the year, we can provide more color.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. And then this – so taking a $100 million of revenue out of the business, I mean, do you just you are short on mechanics, so you presumably the work goes somewhere else to a competitor, is this effectively you guys losing share or how do you get the work back, presumably once it leaves your facility, maybe someone else has a opportunity to establish relationship with the customer or it’s done in-house. Presumably if it’s done in-house, it makes more sense economically to form it out to an independent like yourself, but is this – should we be thinking about this as sort of short-term share loss that you have to go win back?
John Holmes:
It would be – it is effectively a share loss at the moment. But what I would characterize it is we have customers that have – we have contracts with customers and those contracts give us a certain number of lines of maintenance. Now, those lines of maintenance are constantly being adjusted by the customers based on changes to their fleet schedules and how they want to operate their aircraft. But based on those contracts and the lines of maintenance that we have, when we are recovered from a labor standpoint and have capacity to take those lines back, they are still under contracts with us. So customer might say, listen, I got that aircraft to send to you. We will say, well, listen, we can’t take it now, but we can take the next one. That aircraft will go to somebody else and I want to update this and when we have got the mechanics, they can come back to us.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. That makes sense. Last one for me, just any update on the status of the sale of the Airlift assets?
John Holmes:
Yes. We are – it’s progressing. And as we said in the last call, our goal is to have that completed by the end of this fiscal year.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. So, that’s still on track. Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot guys.
John Holmes:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan of Seaport Global. Your line is open.
Josh Sullivan:
Hey, good evening. What are the thoughts on the M&A front at this point? Do you feel like you are the right size in all your verticals to win the pipeline opportunities? Is there a need to go out and acquire labor, just curious on the thought process at this point?
John Holmes:
Well, I mean, M&A in general, we are actively looking. The investments that we have been making have been obviously for organic growth. And again, we are very proud of the organic growth that we have put out this quarter getting up to that $0.59 number. So that’s where the focus is right now. That’s where the focus is right now in terms of our capital. Having said that, there are a number of opportunities that we are aware of that we are tracking that we may see come to market and could be a good fit for us, but right now, the focus is on organic investment and obviously you are seeing in the results with the strong quarter.
Josh Sullivan:
Okay. And then is there any update on the – was it the worldwide logistic support service contract you won in April and I had a pretty big potential value on it progressing on that?
John Holmes:
Yes, that has the $25 billion ID/IQ, so that was processed as it was cleared to protest. They are now in the process of bidding task orders. It’s clear that the government wants to get task orders awarded as quickly as possible and we are hoping to hear some news on that earlier in 2019.
Josh Sullivan:
Okay, thank you.
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to John Holmes for any closing remarks. Sir?
John Holmes:
Well, again we really want to thank everybody for the time and interest in AAR and appreciate all the questions today. And we hope everybody has a wonderful holiday.
Operator:
Thank you, sir. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time."

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR’s Fiscal Year 2019 First Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by John Holmes, President and CEO; and Mike Milligan, Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR’s President and Chief Executive Officer, John Holmes.
John Holmes:
Hey, great. Thank you very much and good afternoon everybody. We appreciate you all joining us to discuss our first quarter 2019 results. Overall, it was a great quarter for AAR. Our first quarter consolidated sales grew 17.2% from $398 million to $466 million, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 64% from $0.33 a share to $0.54 a share in the current quarter. Our results were driven by double-digit growth in our trading, distribution, and programs businesses, as we continue to leverage our integrated aftermarket solutions and global reach to capitalize on multiple growth opportunities. The quarter also included a meaningful contribution from the INL/A Worldwide Aviation Support Services, or WASS contract, with sales of $43.2 million. This program achieved full operational capability at the end of June, and we were formally recognized by the Department of State for the company’s successful transition. In order to fully align our operational capabilities going forward, our government-owned, contractor-operated business, which includes the WASS program will be reported within our Aviation Services segment for all the periods presented. During the quarter, we saw very strong demand in our trading, distribution, and programs businesses, which had healthy double-digit growth in the quarter. As a result, sales in our Aviation Services segment increased 9.2% year-over-year, excluding the impact from the KC-10 and WASS programs. We’re feeling very good about the momentum we have in these businesses, and we expect this growth to continue. Also in the quarter, we experienced softer demand for heavy maintenance services, primarily due to customer schedule changes. These changes have created openings in our hangers and we are working to close on a number of opportunities to fill these openings. Speaking of closing on opportunities, I’m very pleased with our recently announced new business wins, including our expanded business with Air New Zealand to provide power-by-the-hour support for their current fleet and their new fleet of A320 NEOs. This new agreement covers 48 aircraft, including the 30 current-generation 320s, as well as the 18 - as well as 18 A320 NEOs. We went live with the 30 current generation aircraft on September 1, and will phase in the NEOs over a four-year period beginning this fall. We also recently announced another multi-year agreement with Air Malta, covering their NEO fleet as well. These awards demonstrate our ability to successfully deliver PBH solutions to our customers, as well as our capabilities to support the latest generation of aircraft. With that, I’d like to turn it over to Mike to discuss the financials in a bit more detail.
Michael Milligan:
Thanks, John. I’ll take a few minutes to discuss the company’s Q1 fiscal year 2019 financial performance in more detail. Our sales in the quarter of $466.3 million were up 17.2%, or $68.4 million year-over-year. We experienced growth in both segments. Our Aviation Services segment experienced increased sales across parts trading, distribution, and programs, including the INL/A WASS contract, while our mobility business drove the sales increase in the Expeditionary Services segment. Our consolidated gross profit increased $9.6 million, or 15.6% to $71.2 million. Gross profit in Aviation Services increased $9.3 million to $67.1 million. Overall, our gross profit margin was 15.3%, compared to 15.5% in the prior year, primarily due to lower volumes in our airframe maintenance facilities. SG&A expenses were 10.5% of sales during the quarter, compared to 11.2% last year, reflecting improved leverage of our cost structure to support our double-digit sales growth. As we shared at our Investor Day in January, we continue to make improvements throughout - we will continue to make improvements throughout the year to achieve our targeted run rate of SG&A at 10% of sales. To that end, we are pleased with the progress to date. Our adjusted SG&A expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, severance, and restructuring charges were 9.6% of sales for the current quarter, compared to 10.4% in the prior year quarter. Income from continuing operations was $18.9 million, or $0.54 per diluted share. Our income tax expense was favorably impacted by the lower tax rates from last year’s tax reform and a tax benefit related to stock compensation. Overall, adjusted income from continuing operations was $18.8 million or $0.54 per diluted share compared to $11.4 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.2 million, and depreciation and amortization was $10.1 million. Interest expense for the quarter was $2.1 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior year, due to higher average borrowings during the quarter and an increase in the underlying interest rate. While we experienced higher average borrowings during the quarter, we maintained low leverage and significant liquidity. Our debt levels remain low and our coverage ratios and availability are high. Overall, we are confident with our disciplined approach to making investments in our business units, including the strong parts supply activities. As previously discussed, we expect to use cash in the first half of the year, while turning cash flow positive thereafter and becoming overall cash positive for the year. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Mike. Overall, we’ve had a very strong start to the year, and we are pleased with our double-digit sales growth as well as our significant earnings growth. We’re also pleased with the reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales and improved operating margins. We’re encouraged by the robust pipeline of opportunities that we see in both our commercial and government markets, and our balance sheet remains strong, giving us the flexibility to make disciplined investments and support our continued growth. We are reiterating our guidance for FY 2019, which includes sales in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $2.50 a share to $2.80 a share, and EBITDA in the range of $180 million to $190 million. I’m very proud of our team, and I’m confident that we will continue to deliver strong performance. Thank you for your time and interest in AAR. And at this point, I’ll turn it back over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
Good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hey, Rob, how are you?
Robert Spingarn:
Hey, John. A question for you, or maybe a couple of questions on Aviation Services. Just at the top line level, why the realignment - you may have touched on this earlier, but and what is left now in Expeditionary? Just some of the strategy behind that, and then I have a couple more questions around that.
John Holmes:
Yes, sure. On the realignment, given the supply of labor and systems, that’s inherent in the GOCO business, and the fact that the core government programs business is very strong in that area. We felt from a management and synergy perspective that it made a lot more sense to have those two businesses run alongside each other. And so far, that’s off to a great start. As I mentioned, the State Department has been extremely pleased with our transition on INL, and that’s - that team in Aviation Services that’s running this is doing a great job.
Robert Spingarn:
So just to be clear about it, what does that leave in Expeditionary? And how do we feel - or how do we think about that business trending the rest of this year and into next? Is that a lower grower than AS?
John Holmes:
Yes, right, fair comment or fair question. So, inside that business, the larger portion of it is our mobility business, the shelters, containers, and the pallet business. That business right now -- it’s at a moment in time, where it’s up from last year, but overall at a low point. The backdrop for that business, we actually feel quite good about. We’ve announced a few awards in the last couple of quarters, and they’ve got a number of opportunities they’re bidding in RFPs they’ve responded to. So, we’re feeling pretty good about the - that business given the macro environment doing well. And that - the other business in that area is the composites business, but mobility is the bulk of the revenue in Expeditionary Services and we’re feeling pretty good about the growth prospects there.
Robert Spingarn:
And then just going back over to AS, it seems that now that you’re at run rate in the INL contract there.
John Holmes:
Right.
Robert Spingarn:
Should we think about the growth, I want to think about this core growth of 9%, but I’m guessing, that INL doesn’t have growth at that level now that it’s mature, but maybe I’m wrong. So how do we think about AS growth and then the dilution to margins, both from that and from this lower MRO activity?
John Holmes:
Well, we saw - the operating margin level, we were up half a point year-over-year. So, if you think about the mix, we’ve seen a great deal of strength in our parts supply businesses, in the distribution and the trading business, and the commercial programs business, as well as the government programs business outside of INL continue to grow. So, we’re very encouraged by the growth rates in all of those areas. And as you know, those businesses are high margin than MRO.
Robert Spingarn:
Is 10% a good run rate for those 9%, 10%?
John Holmes:
Yes, I would - as you know, we’ve got a long-term growth projection or goal of 5% to 10%. And so, we feel good about the - about that range.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay, all right. So you’re at the upper end lately?
John Holmes:
Yes.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then just on the margins, what was going on in MRO that the volumes were a little lighter and therefore your margins took a little bit of pressure there?
John Holmes:
Sorry, Rob, say that again?
Robert Spingarn:
The margins, you talked about the gross margins, I assume some of that was INL, but was there also - did I see something about lower MRO volumes contributing?
John Holmes:
There was. Yes, we did have lower MRO volumes in the quarter, and you do have a fixed cost base in that business, the volumes - the fixed cost didn’t come out, obviously. So you saw a lower gross margin - slightly lower gross profit margin in that regard. We do expect a much stronger quarter in MRO in Q2, so we expect that to improve.
Robert Spingarn:
And then just as a - just to closer look, was that because it’s the summer season and people were not able to put the aircraft into the shop, so to speak, they were just under too much demand?
John Holmes:
Yes, phenomenally, yes.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay, excellent. Thank you very much.
John Holmes:
Yes. And just one more - just one more point.
Robert Spingarn:
Yes.
John Holmes:
I don’t want to lose sight of the strength in the parts businesses and the strength in the programs businesses. I mean, those businesses are doing exceptionally well right now and we can see - continue to see opportunity and invest in those.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay.
John Holmes:
And those are, as I just mentioned, those are stronger margin businesses in MRO.
Robert Spingarn:
All right. Okay, I’ll step out.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Rob.
Robert Spingarn:
Sure.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your question, please?
Lawrence Solow:
Great, thanks. Good afternoon. Just to follow up on the margin side in the Aviation Services. If the MRO margin is somewhat lower, was it more of an impact from the INL contract, that’s cost plus, that sort of hurts the year-over-year drop as opposed to the drop in MRO volume?
John Holmes:
Yes, it - you saw a little bit of impact from INL as well as MRO. But again, the SG&A as a percentage of sales came down, so our operating margin, while we saw 0.2% decrease in gross profit margin, we saw 0.5% point increase in op margin in the same period.
Lawrence Solow:
And the - some - I thought some of the issues at MRO, not only that the busy flying season, which is a seasonal thing normally every year. There was some delayed deliveries in new aircraft, which is well publicized that, I guess, kept some of the older ones out in the air longer or more pressure on them to stay up in the air. Is that something that you feel has been alleviated, or could that bleed into the more seasonally strong quarter for you guys this quarter?
John Holmes:
It could continue, as I mentioned, we’ve got. So first of all, you’re right and that’s - seasonally, that’s the reason. And historically, we’ve had opportunities with lessors to fill certain slots. Those lessors have had those aircrafts operating those leases have been extended. So we didn’t see those one-off drop in opportunities this season. We do, as I mentioned, we do have some open slots if we go into the next quarter or two, but we’ve got a number of opportunities that we’re focused on right now to fill up those slots.
Lawrence Solow:
And the more…
John Holmes:
And seasonal data business gets stronger as we go through the rest of the year.
Lawrence Solow:
So the margin improvement, you’re sort of building into your guidance, which is unchanged. Is that more of a seasonally? Is it improvement in MRO…
John Holmes:
Yes…
Lawrence Solow:
Is it a mix of everything?
John Holmes:
Correct. Yes, it’s a mixture of everything. Seasonally, you’ve get to pick up there. But again, the parts businesses and the programs businesses are performing very well, and those are higher margin businesses in MRO. So even if you have a little bit of a softness in MRO, we still see improved margins as a result of the strength of those businesses.
Lawrence Solow:
And then the INL, you mentioned the State Department is pleased. Is it - is the - how about you guys, is the profit sort of meeting your - I know it’s early - it’s early in the ramp. Is it meeting your expectations, I guess?
John Holmes:
Yes, yes, we’re right where we expect it to be.
Lawrence Solow:
Okay. And then on mobility, I guess that’s like you said the lion’s share of Expeditionary?
John Holmes:
Yes.
Lawrence Solow:
I thought that growth will be a little bit better this quarter I know, you have secured, I think, a little small piece of IDIQ, I think the last summer, if I’m not mistaken. Can you just maybe just discuss? I know the environment obviously seems like it’s certainly better for the spending. But do you actually have contracts in hand that you think will help you get that?
John Holmes:
We do have contracts in hand and that was just filling individual orders at the timing of filling those individual orders. But overall, we feel good about the growth of that business for the balance of the year.
Lawrence Solow:
Okay. And then just a couple of miscellaneous questions. Do you guys in your release that you show the adjusted SG&A you’re taking out stock comp. But you’re not - I assume you’re not taking out stock comp in your EPS calculation, is that correct?
John Holmes:
No, we are not.
Michael Milligan:
No, we’re not.
Lawrence Solow:
Okay, good. I just wanted to confirm that one. And stock comp looks like it was a little bit higher year-over-year or almost double or any reason for that or?
Michael Milligan:
Just ongoing incentive programs of - like the stock performed well and the company has performed well. And as a result, the expense has been a little bit higher.
Lawrence Solow:
Okay. Last question, your discontinued ops, obviously, it lost somewhat more than it did last year. And I know you’ve - because Afghanistan, obviously…
John Holmes:
Right.
Lawrence Solow:
You lost a lot of that [branding] [ph] stuff.
John Holmes:
Yes.
Lawrence Solow:
Is this going to continue to be a drag? Is there anyway you can, I know, you can’t just walk away from the business. Are there potential buyers, or is it something that might, or at least clipped some of your time and some of your cash flow?
John Holmes:
All of the above. We’ve got a very active process going on right now with the number of parties to exit that business, and it’s a big focus of ours to complete that soon.
Lawrence Solow:
Okay. So you’re confident not to put a time table on it, but sometime maybe only during this fiscal year, you’ll be able to sell that business?
John Holmes:
Yes, that’s our plan.
Lawrence Solow:
Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert of Canaccord. Your line is open.
Ken Herbert:
Hi, good afternoon, John and Mike.
John Holmes:
Hey, Ken.
Ken Herbert:
.:
I’m just trying to get a sense as to sort of the opportunity set and how we should think about that? And maybe you sound very optimistic, but any data points you can provide to support the growth, or at least to the backlog or the pipeline in that business?
John Holmes:
Sure. I’ll give you an unsatisfying answer. We feel good about the pipeline. We - we’ve been growing at a faster rate than the overall market for that and we’ve been taking our market share. We’ve got a very healthy base of 1,300 supportive aircraft at this point, and our marginal cost to support a new aircraft is lower than it was a year ago. So we’re becoming more competitive in that market and we feel good about the pipeline it’s - it remains very strong.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, that’s helpful. And do you get a sense that you’re taking share, or is this really just that the opportunity is growing as airlines like Air New Zealand or fly Dubai or other airlines just increased their deliveries?
John Holmes:
It’s both. It’s taking share as well as moving with the market.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. Okay, that’s helpful. And it looks like jumping over to the MRO business, that was maybe five to six points of growth as a headwind in terms of the top line in the quarter. Is that the right way to think about it?
John Holmes:
Yes, we wouldn’t want to - we don’t comment on the individual growth rates.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. I’m just trying to get a sort of the financial impact of the sort of the open slots in the MRO side?
John Holmes:
Yes, I mean, you’re probably not too far off.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. Okay, that’s helpful. And as you look to fill those slots now and as and obviously, we move out of the summer flying season. It sounds like that that spills maybe into the second, maybe even into the third quarter. Can you talk just roughly about pricing on the MRO side? And with the strong demand, obviously, from the airlines flying where, are you seeing any relief on pricing or labor rates you’re getting in the MRO business? Could that be a - maybe a bit of a tailwind to margins moving through the fiscal year?
John Holmes:
Well, the labor market remains tight. Going into this busy season, we do feel much better prepared to deal with the tight labor market than we did last year at this time. So we’re encouraged by that. We are a leader in this market and our performance is what we’re focused on right now. And through strong performance, we expect to command and we’ve seen this over and over again with our customers. We expect to command a better pricing in the market. We - yes.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. All right, that - that’s helpful. And then just finally, obviously, the benefits of the tax reform in the quarter. Can you remind us, again, what we should assume for a full-year tax rate?
Michael Milligan:
Going forward, Ken, we’ll - we expect our tax rate to be 23% to 24% on a quarterly basis.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, perfect. All right. Well, thank you very much. I’ll pass the mike there.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Ken.
Michael Milligan:
Thanks, Ken.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan of Seaport Global. Your question, please?
Joshua Sullivan:
Hi, good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Good afternoon.
Joshua Sullivan:
Just on the strength in the parts business, how do we think of that ramping relative to the power-by-the-hour contracts you’ve KRW? I’m just curious what is - what portion of that’s global air traffic growth here in the strength there versus the contracts that you won on some of these contracts, some of these airlines?
John Holmes:
Yes, they’re both growing. They’re both growing nicely. And again, we are growing as a result of taking market share, as well as benefiting from the overall spend.
Joshua Sullivan:
Okay. And then, I know you talked about the pipeline there, but can you talk about any progress with the Indian joint venture at this point? What are some the gating factors there just specifically?
John Holmes:
Yes. So thanks for asking about that. That’s going well. We continue to be under construction in the facility. It’s been slightly delayed due to weather conditions over there. But we are on track for a first calendar quarter 2019 opening, and we’re working on securing our first baseload of customers.
Joshua Sullivan:
Okay. And then just lastly, the seasonal leasing changeover business coming in soft here. Does that business shift to the right at all? I assume those aircraft need to be changed over at some point. When we do see - do we see a catch up at some point?
John Holmes:
So it depends. It depends on if we have the maintenance slots available when the aircraft come out, and it also depends on whether or not those leases get extended with the less fees. In other words, when we talk about doing work with the lessors, that means that the aircraft is transitioning from one operator to another, and that lessor puts that aircraft us for interim check. If the lease is extended with the existing operator and that existing operator is not a company of AAR’s, then that work is going to stay with wherever that operator has got it. So it just depends on ultimately, what happens with the movement of those aircraft.
Joshua Sullivan:
Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of SunTrust. Your question, please?
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.
John Holmes:
Hi, Mike.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Just one on the tax clarification. So I think, you said 23% to 24% for the full-year. So we should expect - is that going to be - should we expect fairly linear going up forward kind of a 26.5% tax rate, or do we anticipate anymore kind of a one-time benefits or items?
Michael Milligan:
Yes. At this point, Mike, we’re about 23% to 24% in the quarters going forward. We don’t - we will probably be a little favorable to that rate over the course of the full-year.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay, got it. And then, John, just on the margins. I know, the gross margins down, you obviously talked about it here with the - some of the open slots in MRO. But I mean, you get the seasonal pick up. Should we expect those gross margins to balance next quarter with that volume, or is it predicated on backfilling some of those slots, or is the seasonal strength just going to pull up the overall gross margins?
John Holmes:
Yes, it’s what you said. The seasonal strength that pull up the gross margins and the continued growth in the parts and programs businesses, which are higher margins business. So we do expect to see improvement there.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it, got it. And the labor, you guys think, going back to earlier in the year, you feel comfortable that, even with the seasonal pick up, you kind of won’t get - have any other shortages that you’ve experienced earlier in the year?
John Holmes:
Yes. As I mentioned, it’s still a tight market. But a number of the things that we - the number of the initiatives that we put in place in order to deal with that are working and we feel much better going into the busier season.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. And then just last one, maybe just some news I saw today. Just Southwest, I guess, you do work for them. I think their co-funding and maintenance facility in Maryland, does that have any implications on the level of activity you currently do for Southwest?
John Holmes:
No, we’re not.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay, okay. So that’s just more capacity for them, it’s not going to know…
John Holmes:
Yes…
Michael Ciarmoli:
…it’s not that they’re going to be bringing more in-house or anything like that?
John Holmes:
No, no. And if I’m thinking of the same release that that’s not necessarily heavy maintenance that would be in conflict with the work we do for them.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Perfect. All right. Thanks, guys.
John Holmes:
Okay, thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Klieve of NOBLE Capital Market. Your question, please?
Ben Klieve:
All right. Thank you. A few from here. First on the INL front here. Within our quarter, can you kind of update us on what you think seasonality from that program may look like here?
Michael Milligan:
We see it as - hey, Ben. We see it as fairly steady. At the Investor Day, we articulated, we see it as about $200 million a year contract, and we do see that evenly spread throughout the year now that we are at full run rate.
Ben Klieve:
Okay, perfect. Thank you. And on the international front, I mean, for several quarters in a row here, you just - you seem to have one announcement after another here on the international front, just a lot of momentum here for you. I’m curious if - as you look out over, say, the next I don’t know 12 to 24 months, how do you look at international growth relative - as compared to domestic growth? Is it roughly the same? Is it a multiple factor above domestic growth? How do you see international expansion here?
John Holmes:
Yes. This - in this quarter, we saw a similar growth rate, both the domestic and international growth, but international remains a big focus of ours. We’ve got a great sales team worldwide. As you can see there, they’re having a lot of success capturing business. We’re excited about this India joint venture and getting a facility up and running over there to take the AAR brand farther east. So international expansion is a real focus of ours.
Ben Klieve:
Okay. And then on the WASS IDIQ, any update on when you expect task orders to roll off that vehicle?
John Holmes:
Yes. So the - it’s under protest, no surprise there. And my - I believe we’ve got about another month to go under the GAO protest timeline. So we would hope that by the end of the calendar year, we’d see the first task orders coming out. But that is a fluid situation given the number of bidders on the IDIQ, so that’s just a guess.
Ben Klieve:
Okay. Yes, fair enough. It’s always a guess.
John Holmes:
Yes.
Ben Klieve:
And one last for me. So I understand that we always want more data than you’re able to provide. Given that I’m curious about kind of your future reporting by segment. I mean, I wouldn’t expect that Expeditionary here to standalone in a separately reported segment for long. Do you think - in the future, you’re going to be breaking out what today is the Aviation Services segment more granularly, or do you think you’re going to end up rolling your two current segments into one going forward? How are you thinking about future reporting from that perspective?
John Holmes:
Certainly, we understand the interest in getting more granular detail. We are in an ongoing dialogue with the auditors and others about the segment reporting and that’s something we’ll continue to assess.
Ben Klieve:
All right. Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions. I’ll get back in queue.
John Holmes:
All right, Ben. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
Yes, I just had a couple of more things. On the SG&A, I think, you got down to 10.5% and you’ve targeted 10%. So how do we…
John Holmes:
That’s right.
Robert Spingarn:
…how should we think about that trending from here? And are you ahead of plan? I mean, could you get below 10% or are you just tracking as you want to when do we get there?
John Holmes:
We’re in line with expectations at this point. Consistent with what we articulated at the Investor Day, we’ve got a target to get back to that 10%. We’ve got target to get back to that 10% or slightly below run rate. And as the business continues to grow throughout the year, we expect continued improvement there.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And so, obviously, that strength across some of those businesses in AS is key to that happening. I wanted to ask you specifically about parts trading. You’ve talked about how strong that and some of the related businesses are? Is that a disaggregated market? Are there opportunities there to roll up some of the others that are in the parts trading market make that a bigger business?
John Holmes:
We’re expanding through investments in material and people. We’ve been very successful over the last several years. A number of our competitors have gone away and we’ve been able to take their share. We’ve got a wonderful team. They’re extremely in touch with those markets. They’re able to step out opportunities better than anybody else out there. And our goal right now is to continue to back the team that we’ve got.
Robert Spingarn:
Is there any secular risk that as we deliver more new aircraft and fuel prices stay a little bit elevated and we start to see a return or acceleration, if you will, in retirements, that there is some slowdown on the trading side?
John Holmes:
Certainly, the fuel prices and the commentary coming out of our customers is something we’re keeping a close eye on. But right now given our position in the market, the demand that we see for material over the next several years, as well as our ability to access the material, which is the core competency of ours, we’re quite confident.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then just lastly, sort of going back to where I was before, I had asked about parts trading. But just M&A, in general, just given where your balance sheet is and the ability that you might have to support some M&A. Are there other areas that you’d like to target?
John Holmes:
Rob, we’re always looking. As we’ve said the last few quarters, our cash is being invested in organic growth, which obviously we’re seeing. And - but we’re always - we’ve always got our eye open for the right opportunity.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. How’s the pipeline look for that? The targets?
John Holmes:
There are things out there. As you know, valuations are very healthy, and we always had a very disciplined approach to M&A, there’s nothing that’s going to change our approach.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Ken Herbert of Canaccord. Your line is open.
Ken Herbert:
Hi, John. I just wanted to follow-up just once more on your distribution business. I know you’ve been very successful in adding new OEMs as part of your platform. How do you see that runway through into calendar 2019? Are you getting a sense that a number of OEMs are looking for sort of alternative distribution partners or utilizing distribution? I’m just trying to get a sense as to the growth outlook there from bringing on new OEM partners to your platform relative to just sort of the steady organic growth within the distribution business?
John Holmes:
Yes. Thanks, Ken, it’s a good question. We see both. We see growth in current distribution - with the current distribution partners and then we see a very healthy pipeline of opportunities for new distribution partners. And the success of that business is feeding on itself in a lot of ways. We’re really becoming known for this service both the commercial customers, because we have so many different channels to market such as with our MRO business, or our parts business, or our programs business. We have multiple touch points with commercial customers and the OEMs that we partner with Viasat. And then we’ve also had a great deal of success selling into the DLA, which has turned into a real nice franchise. So the pipeline is strong and it’s a business that we continue to have high expectations of growth.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, that’s great. And just finally, on the MRO business, again, great work on India. And I know you’ve expanded into Canada recently, which historically, when I think of the MRO business for you, it was obviously very U.S.-centric and you seem to have a lot of reluctance to push investments outside the United States. So you’re pushing that envelope. But I guess, what’s next? I mean, we’re seeing a clear growth in fleets in other parts of the world. I think, India, maybe gives you a great foothold. But how should we think about international expansion of the MRO business?
John Holmes:
Yes. Right now, we’re focused on getting India up and running, getting those initial customers secured and getting some success there. And because of the position that, that puts us in, we feel that, that would be a great launch point in other ventures. But right now, we’re focused on getting - being successful with the deal we’ve got in front of us.
Ken Herbert:
Great. Thanks, John. Thanks, Mike.
John Holmes:
All right. Thanks, Ken.
Michael Milligan:
Thanks, Ken.
Operator:
Thank you. At this time, I’d like to turn the call back over to John Holmes for any closing remarks. Sir?
John Holmes:
Thank you very much. Really, I appreciate all the questions and the interest, and appreciate the time and we’ll get back to work.
Operator:
Thank you, sir.
John Holmes:
All right.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may disconnect at this time."

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2018 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Non-Executive Chairman; John Holmes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Milligan, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman of the Board, David Storch.
David Storch:
Thank you, sir. And thank you very much everyone today for participating. Good afternoon. And also thank you for joining us to discuss our most recent fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results. I'm very happy to open up the call by introducing John Holmes as my successor, AAR's new Chief Executive Officer, and only the third CEO in the company's history. In John's role as President, leading our Aviation Services businesses, he's shown keen, strong leadership skills, a great understanding in sense of our markets, and the entrepreneurial skills to take over our great company and to drive it to even greater heights. I'm very excited to watch John perform in his new role as CEO. Before handing the call over to John, I'm pleased to share that AAR had a solid fourth quarter to finish a very strong fiscal year overall and we will walk you through the highlights momentarily. I'm also pleased to share the company has successfully completed the full transition of the INL/A Worldwide Aviation Support Services contract at the end of June. I'm incredibly proud of our team and want to thank the entire team for their dedication and commitment, especially in the period since contract award. Together with John, we are also very proud that AAR was named to the Forbes list of America's Best Mid-Size Employers for 2018. This is a reflection of company's entrepreneurial spirit, validating our culture, enabling us to continue to attract world-class talent. So, with that, what I'd like to do is, turn the call over John to discuss the company's recent results.
John Holmes:
Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everybody. I'd really like to begin by thanking David for the opportunity to lead this outstanding organization. David has been a tremendous mentor and friend for 17 years and it is truly a honor to succeed him. I also want to recognize David for his four decades of exceptional service and leadership to AAR and we will continue to look to David for strategic guidance as we grow the company. We are pleased to report our very strong Q4 and full-year FY18 results. For the full-year, we drove double digit sales growth through strong performance across all of our businesses. Our sales were up $157 million or 10% to $1.75 billion and excluding the impact of the wind-down of the KC-10 Program, which lowered sales by $81.5 million from the prior year, sales increased 16%. This is primarily driven by our industry-leading commercial and government programs, parts supply activities, and MRO offering. As David mentioned earlier, we have completed the WASS program transition, including the sites in Afghanistan, Iraq, Panama, Peru, and Patrick Air Force Base. This program is now fully operational and July will be our first month at a full run rate. In the fourth quarter, the program contributed $14.1 million of sales with minimal operating income contribution. And in the first quarter, we've had one partial month and two full months of operations. During the quarter, we had several significant wins, most notably we're awarded our first indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity or IDIQ contract by the U.S. Army for aircraft and support equipment maintenance, as well as supply chain management in the program. The work will be primarily performed outside the continental U.S. in support of U.S. Army operations. We're pleased to be one of three primary defense contractors on this $25 billion IDIQ and anticipate seeing our initial task orders in mid-FY19. In addition, our distribution team was awarded a new contract with Sumitomo Precision Products to support a critical engine component for the A320 family. This long-term exclusive agreement will be supported by our global customer support team, as well as our global warehousing network. FY 2018 was a year of significant new business capture for AAR and we're all extremely focused on the successful execution of this new business. We're also focused on our cost structure and have taken several actions to reduce our SG&A expenses, including personnel reductions, which resulted in the severance you saw in Q3 and also in Q4. Based on these moves and other initiatives, we see a path to bring SG&A expenses back to our historical level of 10% of sales during the year FY19. We've also taken actions to address the labor challenges we mentioned last quarter that we experienced at certain of our MRO facilities, which included modifying our recruiting efforts to attract more experienced technicians, forming partnerships with local governments and tax schools, and enhancing our internal training programs. Overall, we continue to see robust demand across all of our businesses, in particular our parts supply and commercial and government programs offerings. We have strong momentum and are feeling very good about our prospects going forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike Milligan.
Mike Milligan:
Thanks, John. Good afternoon. I'll take a few minutes to discuss the company's Q4 and full-year 2018 financial performance in more detail. Our sales in the quarter of $473.5 million were up 5.1% or $23 million year-over-year. We experienced growth in both segments, including a $14.7 million, 50% increase in Expeditionary Services revenues, combined with an $8.3 million increase in Aviation Services revenues. The INL/A WASS contract ramp drove the Expeditionary Services sales increase, while Aviation Services experienced strong sales from parts trading, distribution, airframe maintenance and landing gear services, more than offsetting the KC-10 sales decline of $13.8 million to $4.5 million from $18.3 million in the prior year. We continue to see improvement in our business unit profitability, as gross profit increased $6.8 million or 8.7% to $84.7 million. Gross profit in Expeditionary Services improved $3.8 million or 84% from increased sales and higher profitability. Gross profit in Aviation Services increased $3 million from parts supply, airframe maintenance, and landing gear sales flow through. SG&A expense were 13.1% of sales impacted by increased personnel-related costs, including higher stock-based compensation costs, as well as severance and restructuring expense of $2.5 million or $0.05 per share. Adjusted SG&A expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and severance and restructuring charges were 11.2% of sales for the quarter, compared to 11.3% in the prior year. Income from continuing operations was $18.1 million or $0.52 per diluted share, impacted by $1.1 million, $0.03 per share tax benefit related to the deferred tax re-measurement from the U.S. tax law changes. Overall, adjusted income continuing operations was $18.8 million or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to $16.4 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the prior year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.6 million and depreciation and amortization was $9.1 million. Net interest expense was $2.2 million, compared to $1.5 million last year, due to higher average borrowings during the quarter and the increased underlying interest rate. Our sales for the full-year were $1,748.3 million, up 10% or $157.5 million year-over-year. Aviation Services sales grew 16% or $239 million, excluding the impact of the KC-10 Program wind-down. Our sales increases were driven by our parts trading and distribution activities as well as commercial and government programs as well as airframe maintenance and landing gear services. Landing gear – our KC-10 sales were $29 million for the year, down $81.5 million from $110.6 million in the prior year and will have minimal sales going forward. Expeditionary Services sales grew $24 million or 23% to $129.4 million from sales increases from the INL/A WASS contract ramp-up and growth in our mobility business unit. Gross profit for the year increased $31.2 million or 12% to $294.6 million. Gross profit in Aviation Services increased $25.9 million or 10.5% from parts supply, airframe maintenance and landing gear sales flow through. Gross profit in Expeditionary Services improved $5.3 million or 30.5% from increased sales and higher profitability. As we move forward into fiscal 2019, we expect our margins to improve as we grow the business and leverage our fixed cost structure. SG&A expenses were 11.9% of sales for the year, impacted by elevated legal costs, increased personnel related costs, including the higher stock-based compensation, as well as severance and restructuring charges of $4.4 million or $0.09 per share. Adjusted SG&A expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and severance and restructuring charges were 10.8% of sales for the year, compared to 10.6% in the prior year. Income from continuing operations were $73.4 million or $2.11 per diluted share, which were impacted by $14.1 million, $0.41 [ph] per share tax benefit related to the deferred tax re-measurement from the U.S. tax law changes, as well as severance and restructuring charges of $3.1 million or $0.09 per share. Overall, our adjusted income from continuing operations was $62.7 million or $1.79 per diluted share, compared to $52.5 million or $1.53 per diluted share in the prior year. Capital expenditures for the full-year were $22 million. Depreciation and amortization were $40.5 million. Interest expense for the year was $7.9 million, compared to $5.2 million last year due to the higher average borrowings during the year and increased underlying interest rate. Our cash flows operations were positively impacted by our accounts receivable off-balance sheet financing, which generated $61 million. While we experienced higher average borrowings during the year, we maintained low leverage and significant liquidity. Overall, we are confident in the investments that we made in our business units. And during the year, we returned $23.4 million to our shareholders through dividends of $10.3 million or $0.30 per share and share repurchases of $13.1 million or approximately 350,000 shares. Thanks for your interest, and with that, I'll turn the call back over to John.
John Holmes:
All right, thank you, Mike. As we enter FY19, we expect to continue to be a net investor in our businesses to support our customers and our continued growth. We do expect to turn out to cash positive in the second half of the year. At this point, we'd like to reaffirm our guidance for FY19, which includes sales in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion; diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $2.50 a share to $2.80 a share, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $180 million to $190 million. I'm very proud of our team and I'm confident that we will deliver another year of strong performance. Thank you for your time and interest in AAR. And at this point, I will turn it back over to the operator for questions.
Operator:
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Herbert of Canaccord. Your question please.
Ken Herbert:
Hi, good afternoon everybody and congratulations David and John.
David Storch:
Thank you, Ken.
John Holmes :
Thank you, Ken.
Ken Herbert:
I just wanted to first ask, if I could question on the guidance, can you just remind us again for fiscal 2019, what's implied for the INL contract. I know the ramp's been a little slower than expected, but it sounds like it's fully up and running now, but from a revenue or an EPS standpoint, what does that particular contract contribute in fiscal 2019?
John Holmes:
Yes, from a revenue standpoint, consistent with what we talked about in January, it's about $200 million contract in FY 2019, and it's close to that range with the slightly delayed start.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. And your margin assumptions haven't changed on that program either?
John Holmes:
Correct.
Ken Herbert:
Okay. And then if I could, just as a follow-up, your comment, John, at the very end on free cash flow, do you expect to be free cash flow positive in Fiscal 2019, it sounds like first half of the year is more investments than second half you generate – you start to see positive free cash flow, but how do we think about the full year and may be as part of that what's the expected benefit from the off-balance sheet program or how should we think about that contributing in fiscal 2019?
John Holmes:
You're right. We're looking as I said at being a net investor in the first half of the year and going to positive cash flow generation in second half of the year. We're still viewing our cash flow for the full-year in the range that we communicated at the January Investor Day, which would be 50% EBITDA conversion for the year. And in terms of the accounts receivables that – you go ahead, Mike.
Mike Milligan:
Yes, Ken I can assume that the use of the AAR facility will be consistent.
Ken Herbert:
Okay, so sort of neutral from 2018 to 2019?
Mike Milligan:
That's constant. Yes, right.
Ken Herbert:
Yes, constant. Okay. Alright, I’ll hand it back there. Thank you very much.
Mike Milligan:
Thanks Ken.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli of SunTrust. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Good evening guys. Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations. Maybe John, just touch on Aviation Services, I guess in the prepared comments there, you talked pretty optimistically about continuation of the trends across most of the business, but we saw even normalizing for the KC-10, the growth decelerated pretty sharply this quarter versus prior quarters. Any additional color you could provide there, any start of a new trend or kind of what you're seeing under the surface?
John Holmes:
We don't – if we take our KC-10, growth would have been roughly 8.5%, which is in the range that we've been communicating, 5% to 10%. So, we don't see it as any start of a trend, we continue to see, as I mentioned, demand across all of the businesses in the Aviation Services unit. So, the short answer is, I wouldn't view that as part of a trend and 8.5% backing out KC-10 is right in-line with what we've been expecting.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay, and then what about – you touched on labor pressure and kind of some measures you've taken there, how should we think about that labor pressure, if you are going to have to potentially increase wages, can that be passed across or passed on to the airlines that have any margin implications or any implications for hitting that 10% SG&A target for fiscal 2019?
John Holmes:
Yes, I would view those two things differently on the hourly labor and that's where we see the pressure. As I mentioned in the last call, we certainly are in communication. All of the customers are aware of the tightness in the labor supply and the potential downstream implications for costs. The last thing that the customers want to see is, us raising our price to them. So, we are doing what we can with the number of other options that I mentioned to broaden the labor pool. The real constraint there was felt after the summer flying season when we got back to, when the hangers don't back up and the aircraft came back in and we were out there looking for a mechanic. We are well ahead of that exercise this year versus last year. And so far, we've been able to that on a relatively consistent cost base. We've had to make some targeted increases at certain levels within the organization based on experience and try to get certain people into the organization, but nothing at this point that would materially impact the margin. Having said that, that is the trend in terms of the tightness of the labor supply and it's something that we're monitoring closely, which is why I wanted to bring it up.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it, and that shouldn't have any impact on the SG&A dropping to 10% for fiscal 2019?
John Holmes:
No, it's not in SG&A. You've got – those are direct labor cost, right.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan of Seaport Global. Your line is open.
Josh Sullivan:
Hi, good afternoon.
John Holmes:
Hi, Josh.
Josh Sullivan:
Can you just expand on the WASS contract? How do you see that vehicle ramping over the next couple of years? It seems like a nice win.
John Holmes:
So, we are on the IDIQ. And we are one of three large contractors on the IDIQ. There is also a small business component. So, there were three smaller contractors. And the value of IDIQ was up to $25 billion over its 10-year period. And what will happen next is, task orders will come out, what we bid separately. And as each one of those task orders comes out, we'll compete against the other contractors that are on the IDIQ for that task order. So, the first step is getting on the IDIQ to have the ability to bid on the task order, the next step is, winning the task order themselves. At this point, we don't have visibility into the size or duration or the scope of the individual task orders. Obviously, with the $25 billion ceiling, it's pretty significant opportunity, but we do have to compete to win further – to win actual work on that contract.
Josh Sullivan:
Okay, thanks. And then, just could you provide us any color on the pace of parting out or scrapping of aircraft at this point, any trends or themes emerging globally?
John Holmes:
In general, I think there are certain asset classes that are in higher demand than others. We see pockets of demand for certain asset classes based on fleet movement and we're getting ahead of that demand by going out and securing certain assets. I don't want to get into specifics obviously for competitive reasons but suffice to say that both in the engine and airframe market, the trading business continues to look good, but the key is going out there and being able to get your hands on the right material.
Josh Sullivan:
Okay, thank you.
Operator:
Thank you, and at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to David Storch for any closing remarks.
David Storch:
Thank you. Thanks for your participation. One comment back Mike on your comment on the deceleration of revenue growth, just keep in mind as we enter fiscal year 2019, we are forecasting 20% organic growth in this year. So, there may have been a slight deceleration ex KC-10 from prior quarters, however, we're expecting ramps into the new fiscal year that get us into the exceptional growth rate for the year. And with that, I think that's a good way to wrap, and thanks for your participation today, and wish you all well. Thank you.
Mike Milligan:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you, sir and thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Have a wonderful day."

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the AAR's Fiscal Year 2018 Third Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Holmes, President and COO; and Mike Milligan, Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to ARR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Storch. Mr. Storch, you may begin.
David Storch:
Thank you, and good afternoon to all. Q3 as you can see was another strong quarter for the company as both sales and profitability increased sequentially, and versus the prior year period. Consolidated sales increased 12% from $407 million to $456 million, while gross profit margin increased to 17% from 16.3% in the prior year's quarter. We again experienced double-digit revenue growth in our Aviation Services businesses and benefited from investments we made in all of our supply activities. Our strategy driving sales growth across all of our connected businesses through our best-in-class aviation services on track. Our differentiated capabilities provides the basis to continue on our existing growth trajectory as we progress through our long-term transformation. Our teams are focused on execution to drive efficiencies and profitability. We expect this momentum to continue as we ramp up services on our recent contract awards, including the US Air Force Landing Gear PBL and the State Department INL/A Worldwide Aviation Support Services programs. During the quarter, we continued on the INL/A efforts and expect to be at a full run rate by the end of fiscal year and the Landing Gear PBL will kick in, in the April -- in April or this quarter. So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to John, John will be followed up by Mike, and I will wrap up the commentary before we open for Q&A. John?
John Holmes:
Great. Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everybody. As David mentioned, we had another solid quarter, especially in Aviation Services, which was led by strong performance in our industry-leading integrated supply chain solutions and parts supply activities. Within our Aviation Services business, sales increased 11.4% in the quarter over the prior year. We continue to see significant growth in our trading business as a result of strong demand and also our leading market position. Our distribution business also performed well as previously announced OEM distributorships continue to ramp up. The commercial programs group focused on executing on the large number of contracts we’ve secured over the last several quarters. MRO, the integration of our newly acquired Canadian operation is progressing well and the new sites have exceeded our expectations both financially and operationally. Elsewhere, at two of our other MRO facilities we experienced some labor pressure as the market is tightening for skilled technicians. We are working to get a handle on this situation and we have a number of initiatives underway. We continue to invest in each of these businesses to support the growth as well as to develop new capabilities such as digital enhancements, all of which will further strengthen our competitive position. We are also focused on the ramp up, as David mentioned, of the Air Force Landing Gear PBL contract with our first job inputs in February and we will fully go live on this important program on April 1. Within our Expeditionary Services segment, sales increased $5.5 million or 22.5% from the prior year primarily reflecting the continued recovery in sales volumes for mobility products business. As previously discussed, as part of securing the WASS contract, we’ve been shifting our resources to focus on the growing -- on growing the government-owned, contractor-operated or GOCO business. As a result, we’ve decided to perceive the sale of our contractor-owned contractor or COCO business, which was formerly included in the Expeditionary Services segment. These moves are designed to deliver world-class service to our government customers as we pursue more GOCO contracts going forward. Regarding WASS, the transition is proceeding well and we’ve recently begun performing certain critical functions for the Department of State. Overall, certain transitional elements have compressed and we do not expect to see the full $50 million of transition revenue highlighted during Investor Day before we go live on May 1. The WASS contract contributed less than $3 million of revenue in Q3, and we expect that to be about $25 million in Q4. As I mentioned, the program will go live on May 1, at which point we expect to be at full run rate and it will become a contributor to earnings. We are all very focused on delivering world-class service to the Department of State. I do want to mention some other recent awards as well that we announced during the quarter. We announced a 7-year contract from the Naval Air Systems Command or NAVAIR for airframe maintenance and AOG support of the P-A8 fleet for the U.S Navy, Government of Australia and other foreign military sales customers. AAR's work on the P-A8 Airframe which is a 737 derivative will be performed at AAR's MRO facilities in Indianapolis, Oklahoma City and Miami. This is an important contract win for us. It's our first with the -- with NAVAIR and the P-A8 fleet is large and growing. We also announced during the quarter our new joint venture for the development of a heavy maintenance facility in Central India. This new MRO facility will begin operations in FY2019. We’ve already been investing in this venture and expect investments to continue over the next several quarters and we’re really excited to bring our brand and know-how to this important and growing market. Overall, we have a lot of momentum and we’re feeling really good about our prospects going forward. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Milligan:
Thanks, John. Good afternoon. I will take a few minutes to discuss the company's Q3 fiscal '18 financial performance in more detail. We experienced strong sales from continuing operations in the quarter of $456.3 million, up 12% or $49 million year-over-year. Our sales growth was driven by the $44 million sales increase in our aviation services segment, specifically in parts trading and distribution, commercial programs as well as MRO and Landing Gear Services. KC-10 sales were $3.6 million in the quarter, down $20.7 million from $24.3 million in the prior year and will have minimal sales going forward. Our Expeditionary Services sales increased $5.5 million in the quarter. These sales increases were generated by our mobility operations and the startup of our transition services for the INL/A WASS contract. Income from continuing operations was $31.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share impacted by a $13 million or $0.38 per diluted share tax benefit related to the estimated remeasurement impact from the U.S Tax Law changes. Also, our provision for income taxes was favorably impacted by a $1.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share, estimated rate reduction to 30% from the current -- for the current fiscal year heading to 24% in fiscal year '19. With the ongoing focus of improving the profitability of our business units, consolidated gross profit in the quarter increased $11.1 million to 17% or 17% to $77.6 million. Gross profit in Aviation Services increased $8.5 million or 13% driven by the strong performance of our parts supply unit. Gross profit in Expeditionary Services increased $2.6 million from increased sales volumes and improved profitability at our mobility business. SG&A expenses were 11.7% of sales during the quarter impacted by higher legal expenses and increased personnel related costs, including higher technology spending as well as early-retirement severance charges of $1.1 million or $0.02 per share. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.8 million and depreciation and amortization were $10.6 million. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $2.2 million compared to $1.3 million last year due to higher average borrowings during the quarter and an increase in the underlying interest rate. We will continue to focus on improved cash conversion, increased liquidity, and ample availability to take advantage of market opportunities. To provide additional financial flexibility, we entered into an accounts receivable working capital facility of up to a $150 million. Our cash from operations -- cash flow from operations were positively impacted by this accounts receivable, off-balance-sheet financing which generated $52 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we returned $10.4 million to shareholders through dividends of $2.5 million or $0.075 per share, and share repurchases of $7.9 million or approximately 201,500 shares. Average diluted share count for the quarter was 34.5 million compared to 34.2 million in the third quarter of last year. Thanks for your interest. And I will turn the call back over to David.
David Storch:
Thanks, Mike, and thanks, John. As you can see we had another great quarter for the company. I’m very excited about the future given the investments we've made in the leadership team that we have in place. In closing, we're affirming our guidance of fiscal 2019, which we previously announced at our Investor Day, in January. This guidance includes sales in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $2.50 to $2.80, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $180 million to $190 million. We also expect Q4 to be an improvement over Q3. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for any questions you might have. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Herbert with Canaccord.
Kenneth Herbert:
Hi. Good Afternoon.
David Storch:
Hi, Ken.
Kenneth Herbert:
Hi. I wanted to see, Mike or John or David, for the INL contract, it seems like the ramps may be a little slower than you’ve been expecting? I can appreciate there's a lot here to get this going. But can you -- aside from what you provided here for the remainder of the estimate here for the fourth quarter, are you still on track as part of the reaffirm the full-year '19 guidance for what you talked about is the INL contribution and can you just talk a little bit about the ramp and how you see that progressing through '19 and again the overall numbers or overall contribution you’re expecting from the contract in fiscal '19?
John Holmes:
Sure, Ken. It's John. I wouldn’t describe the ramp is slower. I would describe it as more compressed. In other words, when the original task orders associated with the $50 million was put out, there were some assumptions made that certain functions would be taken over by AAR over time. The way State has worked with us and laid it out, those functions are really all going to be taken over in a very short period of time at the end of the transition period. And once those are taken over, we go live officially on the whole program on May 1 and at that point we expect to be at full run rate which is consistent with the numbers we presented in January.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay, great. Thanks. And if I could just one follow-up on Aviation Services, I mean you are still seeing very good growth. It sounds like on the parts side of the business, can you just provide any more color specifically on the parts trading and distribution, maybe where you are seeing the growth? Are there any particular aircraft types or engines that you see the lot of activity in, and I guess -- now the comparisons and you start to anniversary, your laps are much more difficult, comps how are you -- how do you see growth through the remainder of this year into fiscal '19 for those businesses within Aviation Services? Thank you.
John Holmes:
Sure. Thanks. John, again. Really the growth in the parts businesses has been across the board, both in the trading on the engine and airframe side as well as in distribution across multiple of our distributorship line and that covers -- and in distribution that covers both the commercial and government markets. So we’re really seeing increased demand all over. There's a couple of new programs that we have signed in those businesses that we expect to continue to ramp over the next several quarters. So we remain confident right now about the continued growth in those businesses.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn:
Hi. Good evening. What’s the sale of the COCO business, what contracts are going with that? And I assume all the assets whatever aircraft are left, could you just walk through that a little bit?
David Storch:
Yes. So we don’t have a sale, per se, at this moment, but we will be putting the businesses up for sale. And the contracts that are associated with that business are no longer reflected in our sales numbers.
Robert Michael:
Okay. And then, if you could just clarify, with regard to the out -- your guidance to the '19 guidance, that that stays the same despite this decision?
David Storch:
Yes, correct.
Robert Spingarn:
And why is that? If you hadn't come to this conclusion …
David Storch:
We are seeing good growth in our businesses, and we feel good about the prospects for hitting those targets that we established.
Robert Spingarn:
So the retained business has improved to offset the loss of the contribution from the sold business or the potentially -- the discontinued business.
David Storch:
So the revenues are we feel that we can pick up the revenues through the growth of our other businesses and the contribution margin from the business that we are looking to sell has been negligible.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. All right. So at least from an EBIT perspective that makes some sense, although if the other businesses are ….?
John Holmes:
Yes, we’ve been -- Rob, so to be clear, we’ve been transitioning our interest and our energy around this new contract which is obviously a very meaningful piece of business for the company. And we’re eager to commence work on this contract and have gone ahead and reallocated our resources to make certain that we’re successful in this regard. So …
Michael Milligan:
So just -- that’s what you’re seeing here.
Robert Spingarn:
Yes, I just want to make sure I understand this though. So if the sales are an offset, you lose the COCO sales, you offset that pretty much wholly with better growth in the existing businesses. I assume you mean Aviation Services, primarily along with the GOCO business which are profitable and you’re losing profit list sales, shouldn’t there be higher profit next year?
David Storch:
We are -- you’re asking what the -- you’re asking in relationship to the expectations that we established at the Investor Day. And but we’re saying it's yes to your question about should we expect more profits last year [ph], I think you can see by the numbers that we’re putting out there that will be significantly more profitable next year.
Robert Spingarn:
Not more than last year. More than your initial expectation for '19.
David Storch:
Excuse me, excuse me. I -- Rob, the answer is that we will be much more profitable next year than we’re this year. And we will -- we are forecasting that. We’ve communicated that. And that’s what we’re expecting.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. I will ask you the question offline. With regard to the 18% growth that you saw in the quarter X KC-10, in aviation services. Can you talk a little bit more about how that trended throughout the businesses. I think John the answer to that question, I think we’ve had consistent growth across all of the businesses in that segment.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.
Lawrence Solow:
Just a few follow-ups from that. The -- it sounds like the MRO piece this quarter maybe under organic basis. Didn’t quite grow as fast as the other pieces that’s fair to say.
David Storch:
Yes, I think that’s a -- I think that’s fair to say.
Lawrence Solow:
Okay. Okay. And then just -- so just to clarify not to beat the diverse, on the COCO peats that you’re selling this quarter -- you know that you know just selling. Its profitable or not profitable. Its negligible in a way, but it sounds like I think your last quarter it was a little bit of a pain to earnings. It's fair to say this quarter it would have been negative turnings, so, yes, you pulled the way a couple of cents that would have actually been negative?
David Storch:
I think that’s a good way to look at it, yes.
Lawrence Solow:
Right, and so then your -- whatever maybe '20, I don’t know if I can quantify the sales impact, but we can do it offline. Okay. Just -- and then, I guess, those are the remaining Expeditionary Services at this quarter, essentially is really just mobility and the $3 million of INL revenue.
David Storch:
Slightly less than $3 million of INL and mobility, that’s correct.
Lawrence Solow:
Okay. And then was there some SG&A was a little higher than I thought it would be. I know there was a $1 million of severance there. Was there some expenses for INL, was there some stuff in front of the Landing Gear contract? Any other reasons for the SG&A number being a little high?
David Storch:
Yes. In both regards the answer is yes. More so in INL, but yes increased expenses in preparation for INL/A.
Lawrence Solow:
So the INL is actually -- you actually have lost dilutive this quarter?
David Storch:
No, I won't say dilutive, but I won't say it was -- it was not additive.
Lawrence Solow:
Okay. So probably those $3 million [indiscernible] $3 million in sales. Okay, sounds good. Thanks. I appreciate it, David.
David Storch:
Yes.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on sticking to this -- the COCO piece, what was the revenue run rate, the annual revenue run rate of the business that you’re going to try and sell here?
David Storch:
For which period are you referring to? Because the business went through a steady decline, if you will. So which period would you like us to address?
Michael Ciarmoli:
I guess what …
David Storch:
Would you like to discuss that offline?
Michael Ciarmoli:
Well, I mean, I just get back-- getting back to Rob's question, I mean, I will pick round numbers here. I mean, if you’re swapping out $35 million or $40 million of no margin business and you’re making it up with $35 million or $40 million of higher margin aviation business, profitability will be greatly improve yet next year, yes, but it seems like there should be some potential incremental upside to the earnings guidance. And I think that’s kind of -- again, swapping out lower margin revenues with higher margin, do we see some potential upside to that earnings number that you’ve kind of laid out already and reaffirmed? I think that’s what we’re trying to hit on.
David Storch:
Yes, so keep in mind then the earnings guidance we are giving you a range, right. I mean, you got a range in that regard. So I’d say this action strengthens our confidence, let's say in the potentially higher end of the range.
Michael Ciarmoli:
That’s perfect. And then, maybe just you touched on the labor pressure. Can you just elaborate, I mean, we’ve certainly got -- there's a lot of growth in the aftermarket, there's certainly more planes coming into service on a regular basis here. Is this something -- I think you talked about some initiatives, but can you pass these rates through to the end customer or maybe just elaborate a little bit more on that dynamic?
John Holmes:
Yes, sure. It's something that has been going on for some time, and this is certainly an industry dynamic not just an ARR dynamic and -- and right, so we’re -- we’ve a number of recruiting initiatives going on. We have internal training initiatives where we’re taking some of our more experienced workforce on certain sites to import to other sites to train up newly [indiscernible] technicians. And then on the wage side, there are certain levels in the organization where we’re looking at compensation adjustments. And then on a broader sense, we’re already in dialogue with certain of our customers about potentially having to adjust pricing as a result of the wage pressures. And the customers are very aware of this.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. So no immediate push back? I mean, it sounds like they are receptive to some of these price increases?
John Holmes:
We started the conversations and they all understand the dynamic and we’re a very important provider to them and an important part of the supply chain and they want to make sure that we’re successful.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay, got it. And then, last one, just on the INL contract. I think you talked at the Investor Day about $200 million to $225 million, but potentially talked about there could be room for some scope increases there. How are you guys thinking about sort of the annual potential even if it's not '19 beyond '19, do you see more runway for opportunity on that contract as you start to get up to full rate?
John Holmes:
We do. I think we’re in the exact position in that regard as we were at the Investor Day. The only thing that really changed as I mentioned was that the timing of certain events during the transition period.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Got it. All right. Outstanding. Thanks, guys. I will turn back in the queue here.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ben Klieve with NOBLE Capital Markets.
Benjamin Klieve:
All right. Thank you. A few questions here. First regarding the mobility business. I’m curious with this being a greater and greater relative contributor to us in the top line, if you could elaborate a bit on the level of fixed cost in this business now that the segment is growing. And kind of what we can look at from an operating margin perspective from that segment?
David Storch:
Can you repeat the question, Ben? You’re cut out.
Benjamin Klieve:
Yes, I’m sorry about that. So in the mobility business was it being a greater and greater contributor on the top line? I’m curious if you can elaborate a bit on the level of fixed cost in that business? And then, the margin -- the operating margin potential in that business as it theoretically continues to grow here going forward?
David Storch:
Well, the business although it’s up on a year-over-year basis, it is not approaching historical levels at this time. In terms of the fixed cost to support that business as that business does continues to see growth. We don’t expect much in the way of additional costs. So as this business receives contracts, it is a pretty profitable activity for the -- its a very profitable activity for the company.
Benjamin Klieve:
And so -- and you …
David Storch:
Yes, go ahead.
Benjamin Klieve:
So you've crossed threshold or breakeven for this business then …
David Storch:
Yes.
Benjamin Klieve:
… so -- okay, perfect.
David Storch:
Yes.
Benjamin Klieve:
And then a question regarding the India MRO facility, so first, John, I didn’t catch what you said regarding the date in fiscal 2019. What was your comments around that date?
John Holmes:
Yes, late in 2019 or into fiscal 2019 is when we anticipate being inducting our first aircraft.
Benjamin Klieve:
Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then, so looking in the late '19 or 2020, I’m curious if you can just elaborate a ...
John Holmes:
Sorry, go ahead.
Benjamin Klieve:
… elaborate a bit more on the -- I’m curious, if you can just elaborate a bit more once that facility is up and running. It really -- I’m -- it sounds like a very high ceiling opportunity. I’m wondering if you can help us kind of understand what you see as the opportunity there from that facility?
John Holmes:
Sure. So it's the narrow-body facility, we are in negotiations with two different baseload customers. We would have between four and six lines of narrow-body maintenance. Currently those customers are sending their work out of the country, so they’re interested in bringing that work back in the country to bring jobs to India. We hope that we would be in a position to announce those contracts here relatively soon. And that -- in these two phases of the facility planned, the first investment phase is one hanger like I said can take up to six narrow-body lines. The second phase would be a similar size hanger that would be able to take another four to six lines on the same-site. We’ve secured land to be able to construct both facilities and just to go back we do expect to be able to conduct our first aircraft in the middle of FY19.
Benjamin Klieve:
Perfect. Okay that’s really exciting. Its -- that’s great to hear. That does it for me. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I will get back in queue.
John Holmes:
Thanks, Ben.
David Storch:
Thanks, Ben.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. I would now like to turn it back over to management for any closing remarks.
David Storch:
Well, thank you very much for today’s questions and hopefully we were helpful. I wish everybody a nice evening, and speak to you soon. Bye-bye.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day."

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the AAR's Fiscal Year 2018 Second Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Holmes, President and COO; and Mike Milligan, Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to ARR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch:
Thank you, and good afternoon all. Let me start by wishing everyone a very happy holiday season, and a great new year. Q2, as you can see, was a solid quarter for the company as we increased sales and profitability on all of our Aviation Services businesses, began work on the INL/A contract and made solid investments that will support growth into the future. We continue to gain momentum in our program business, and I'm exceptionally pleased with the progress that the recently added team has made. I'm also pleased with the opportunistic buys made by our trading team as we benefited from aircraft movement. We have unquestionably the best trading team in the industry. We expanded our MRO network with the acquisition of 2 facilities in Canada that allows us to grow our relationship with Air Canada and others. In the Expeditionary services segment, we are very excited to have begun work on the INL/A contract. We are off to a great start. Also in this segment, certain key contracts for USTRANSCOM rolled off as expected. Given where the opportunity is for us today, we are shifting resources and repositioning talent to focus on what is generally referred to as the government-owned, government -- contractor operated, or GOCO, service model. As many of you know, the helicopter market has been under pressure the last 3 to 4 years, requiring us to take the impairment action we took. Our plan is to sell some of the assets and deploy some of the -- redeploy some of the assets as markets dictate. So with that, what I'd like to do this call to -- turn the call over to John. John will be followed by Mike, and I'll wrap up the commentary before we open for questions and answers.
John Holmes:
Great. Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everybody. As David mentioned, our Aviation Services segment performed very well during the quarter with a sales increase of 13% and $346.7 million to $391.6 million. Gross profit margin in this segment also increased from 16% in the prior year's quarter to 17% in the current year. I'm exceptionally pleased with our sales growth to commercial customers which came in at 20%, as we benefited from the successful ramp of our program contract, growth in our part supply businesses and expansion of our MRO network. During the quarter, we announced a few new business wins as well. They included 2 contracts that we signed for heavy maintenance services with Air Canada. One of those was a 5-year contract covering their 767 Suite, and that's work that we are going to be performing down at our Miami facility. We signed a second contract also with Air Canada, 10-year deal covering Air Canada's A320 family and E-190 fleet. This work is being performed at our newly acquired Canadian facilities, and I should mention that the integration of those facilities are actually going very well, and we've already delivered several aircraft on time to Air Canada under this contract. We were also awarded -- also an MRO, a long term contract with Republic airline to perform heavy maintenance on its fleet of 188 Embraer 170 and 175 aircraft. And I am sure most of you know they're a co-share partner to United American and Delta supporting their operations with that fleet. As many on you know, the government markets as David mentioned in support of troop movements continue to be soft. And as a result, we have experienced decreased positions in our company-owned, company-operated, or what is generally known as COCO business, over the last few years. As David mentioned, we are excited to begin work on the WASS program, and are taking action to reposition our resources in order to focus on more contracts like WASS, where we operate government-owned assets. As David indicated, this business is generally known as government-owned, contractor-operated services, or GOCO, and we plan to pursue more contracts of this nature going forward. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike Milligan, who will talk about the financial results in more detail.
Michael Milligan:
Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everybody. I'll discuss the company's Q2 fiscal '18 financial performance in more detail. We experienced increased sales in the quarter of $449.7 million, up 6% or $25.9 million from the same period in the prior year. Our sales growth was driven by strong performance in our Aviation Services segment. Sales at Aviation Services increased $45 million or 13% year-over-year. The $391.6 million from sales growth in integrated solutions, including supply chain, MRO services and parts and supply -- parts supply, which more than offset the reduced year-over-year sales from the KC-10 contract of $20 million. We experienced the sales decline in Expeditionary Services as indicated in the release. Gross profit in Aviation Services increased $10 million to $66 million in the quarter from operating gains in maintenance services, trading and distribution. While the gross profit in Expeditionary Services was negatively impacted by the noncash impairment charges and the contract completions in the period. SG&A expense of $54.8 million included $4 million of the noncash impairment charge, increased legal costs related to the INL/A, contract defense and deal related costs. Excluding these costs, SG&A expenses were more than 11% of sales. We have historically been in the 10% range for these costs compared to sales. We'll share our plans of reverting to the historical levels in our Investor Day presentation in January. Our consolidated reported net loss was $22.6 million or $0.66 per share in the quarter, which included the impact of the $34.7 million after-tax impairment charge. This noncash impairment charge represents the effect of the write-down of certain aircraft and related support parts. As reported, our adjusted net income was $12.1 million or $0.35 per share, which included operating losses of $1.6 million or $0.03 per share in Expeditionary Services as we indicated. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.7 million and depreciation, amortization was $13.9 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $2.6 million or $0.075 per share. As of November 30, $245 million remains available under the board-authorized share repurchasing plan. Thanks for your time. And I'll let David wrap up our prepared remarks.
David Storch:
Thanks, Mike, and thanks, John, from before. During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategy to become the best, independent aviation service provider in the world. I am very excited about our progress, investments we've made, the team in place and the favorable markets. And in closing, for those of you who may not know, there was a tax code changed recently passed, and we preliminarily estimate that the positive -- the impact on our company's fiscal '19 results will be somewhere in the range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share as a result of the change in tax rate. We'll provide more detail for our fiscal '19 plan at our Investor Day in January. So thanks, so much for participating, and I look forward to any questions that you might have.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ken Herbert.
Kenneth Herbert:
David or John, really nice growth in Aviation Services. And you specifically called out, obviously, some of the heavy MRO and programs business. Can you provide just any more granularity how much of the growth in the Aviation Services in particular was MRO? And specifically, the incremental work with Air Canada and the facilities you've taken on versus maybe organic growth that you saw in programs and on the parts side?
David Storch:
Ken, most of that growth is organic. There was approximately, if you look at the net level, about 3% came through acquisitions in that segment. But largely, it's -- it would be organic growth.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay, okay. That's great. And then within that, can you just update us on sort of how the flydubai contract is going and the opportunity to expand that work as that airline obviously continues to take deliveries of Max aircraft in particular?
John Holmes:
Yes, thanks for asking about that. The contract is going well. We're live on -- there are two contracts the NG contract and the MAX contract. We're live on both. And we expect that our contract will be extended to cover the additional aircraft that they just ordered.
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay, great. And just finally, can you provide an update on what you view now as the fiscal '18 contribution from INL's specifically, now that, that's obviously kicked off and up and running?
David Storch:
Okay, I think we'll be in a better position to discuss that at the Investor Day. We're -- it really early innings -- you know, like top of the first, I guess, in Ireland. So why don't you give us a little bit more time on that?
Kenneth Herbert:
Okay. Got it. So you're throwing out the first pitch, but I guess it's fair to say it's starting off as expected?
David Storch:
Yes, yes. We're very pleased. And I believe, State department is very pleased as well. And we've seen that we've put a great team on the field.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Larry Solow.
Lawrence Solow:
Just sticking with the INL tune, I know you don't want to get too deep into the weeds there. But is it fair that, I guess, during the ramp-up period, it should be pretty much a breakeven for you guys? Is that how we should view that?
David Storch:
Well, I would view is -- I'd view the contribution, the ramp is modest.
Lawrence Solow:
Okay, okay. Fair enough. But I think there's a -- right? It's -- you're paid on cost right, they're refunding you that, right? So it's not a -- okay. And then just on the -- expeditionary, and then we'll go back into Aviation services. Was -- if it's excluding INL, which obviously is going to change the numbers a lot. And maybe it'll be in both segments. I don't know if that's been worked out yet. But the profit level this quarter, was it -- was there actually some gross profit, excluding the charges? And is this sort of the level that we should continue now that Afghanistan is out of there? Or is there -- was it in part of the quarter? Was there other things declining?
David Storch:
Larry, I think we're trying to indicate where our thinking is, right? In terms of where we're taking that business. I think you can see that, hopefully. And we'll be in a better position to comment, as I indicated, at the January Investor Day.
Lawrence Solow:
Okay. Just high-level, obviously, you know this is the -- the INL, big contract and towards your strategy of the GOCO, other -- significantly other opportunities out there? Maybe not of this size -- not of this magnitude? And does the contract win, I guess, help you open more doors for you and get other opportunities?
David Storch:
We believe so. Yes, yes. We believe so.
Lawrence Solow:
Okay. Aviation services...
David Storch:
Yes, go ahead.
Lawrence Solow:
Just get a little better feel for the growth in Aviation Services. It sounds like it's pretty broad based. The MRO and the trading business is obviously have -- haven't had the type of growth that programs and distribution have. And I am probably guessing, they probably weren't quite as high this quarter either. But fair to say programs and distribution still driving the better portion of the growth? And then, part 2 of that question is the margin improvement, anything behind that? Timing? Mix? Sustainability?
David Storch:
Yes, for the first question, in this quarter, we saw growth across the board. So the trading business, the distribution business, MRO and programs all contributed. So everybody had a good quarter. And can you repeat your second -- second half of your question?
Lawrence Solow:
Just on the gross margin. You had a nice improvement in gross margin. I think MRO is actually -- generally has a maybe a little bit of a lower margin too, historically. So just trying to get a little pulse on the improvement. Was it just a mix? And is it a sustainable type of improvement? And what you're think of going forward?
John Holmes:
It was a mix. And each of the business, as I would say, showed a little improvement in the gross margin. So similar to sales, we saw growth across the -- improvement across the board there. And we do believe it's sustainable.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli.
Unidentified Analyst:
This is actually Les [ph] in for Michael. Quick question on the $0.35 to $0.45 tailwind to tax. Can you walk us through how you get there? Somewhat of a bridge. And also, how you handle the deferred tax assets and liabilities?
Michael Milligan:
Well, we basically are moving our effective tax rate in line with our estimates of where we think that'll be. The deferred taxes, we did not make an adjustment for that in that estimate, but we'll recognize that as we go forward in next year.
Unidentified Analyst:
Okay, got it. And then also, there's significant appointment of the Chief Digital Officer, can you kind of talk us through how this business is going? How it's evolving over the long-term? And where do you see the aftermarket services going?
Michael Milligan:
So as it relates to digital, there's a couple of ways to think about that. We're excited to get Andrew on the team. He is already -- we're already learning a lot from him. We're thinking about digital across the whole company. And it will impact different areas of the business in different ways. We're looking at it from really two standpoints. One is a refresh of the way our systems work and the way our people interact with those systems to get them more efficient. And the second is using digital data analysis, et cetera, to drive traditional -- to drive sales of our traditional businesses. So we've got a number of efforts underway to be more robust in terms of how we collect and analyze data to do better price thing and ultimately, capture more market share.
Unidentified Analyst:
Got it. And then I guess last one, on the general update on the industry trends, and as far as shop business expectations for 2018, any comment there?
Michael Milligan:
I mean in general, we see positive trends in terms of inputs.
Unidentified Analyst:
I'd say, year-over-year, in 2018 would you expect it to be a stronger year than 2017?
Michael Milligan:
I think we'll talk about that a bit more in detail in January.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Ben Klieve.
Benjamin Klieve:
So first a couple, just kind of bookkeeping questions here. I had -- the KC-10 program in Q2 last year, I had $29.4 million as revenue. But, Mike, you said $20 million today. Is there...
Michael Milligan:
You're right. It was $29.4 million. It's down to $9.3 million. It's down $20 million.
Benjamin Klieve:
It's down. Got you. Okay, I apologize.
David Storch:
There still some revenue coming in. And so the difference is down $20 million.
Benjamin Klieve:
Right. Got it, okay. And then, another question regarding the Air Force Landing Gear Award, are you able to quantify the revenue contribution during the second quarter from that award?
Michael Milligan:
No.
David Storch:
Yes, we can quantify. There was none.
Michael Milligan:
Yes.
Benjamin Klieve:
None? Okay. But the ramp of that contract is still, it's still on course? There is no issues with that contract so far? Everything is going all right?
Michael Milligan:
Yes, you're correct. It's ramping up or it will ramp up as expected and we'll start seeing contribution in the Q4 time period.
Benjamin Klieve:
And so the announcement you made of, Andrew Kemmetmueller, I think it's really interesting. Looking forward to hearing more about that going forward here. One question I have is, before you brought him on last week, what do you really feel was lacking in your digital presence before? I know you talked a bit about that, but I mean, what really drove the creation of this position? What was the big gap that you felt needed to be addressed?
David Storch:
I don't know if I'd characterize it as a big gap. We felt that we have an IT organization in the company that we've had for a long time. And then the digital services group is about 18 months old. And they were really existing separately. What Andrew's skill sets brings to us is the ability to have both of those organizations inside the company report to one person, because there's a lot of overlapping efforts. And we're looking to him to coordinate that. We -- at the MRO conference over in London a few months back, we launched a few of our new digital services. We got a part store, so we're selling parts online. We got some portals that we put out to help our program customers. And Andrew has got a whole pipeline of ideas that we'll continue to add in that portfolio of digital products. So bringing the digital team, the IT -- the traditional IT team together and continuing to come up with new ideas for digital innovation is what we're looking for from Andrew.
Benjamin Klieve:
Got you. That's very interesting. Last question for me and I'll jump back in queue here is the announcement with the Republic Airline, was that a -- is that a completely brand-new relationship or was that an expansion of an existing relationship?
John Holmes:
It's a new heavy maintenance relationship. We've had a relationship with Republic for some time.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan.
Joshua Sullivan:
Just on the Aviation Service side, as you're doing your forecasting for the next year, you look at the power by the hour opportunities out there. Is there any way to quantify maybe what's in the pipeline? Just trying to get an idea if there is more airlines out there looking for new suppliers, just given some of the advancements, the technology and the digital offering that you're putting out there.
Michael Milligan:
It's a pretty mature product at this point. We continue to see a robust opportunity pipeline. And we can talk a bit about more about the number of opportunities at the January conference.
Joshua Sullivan:
Okay, great. And I guess, can you help us with any of the dynamics maybe around the wide-body MRO service work? Are you seeing any supporting trends possibly moving work back to North America? Is it your Rockford facility maybe built around that trend? You see any interest in that facility at this point?
John Holmes:
Yes, we continue to have interest in Rockford. We're doing work for 3 different customers up there right now. The big focus for us, in the MRO facility is attracting talent, technicians. And we are starting to see some pressure in certain markets on wages.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Brad Evans [ph].
Unidentified Analyst:
Just a question on bookkeeping item actually. Is -- was there -- there was reference to a $4 million impact to the SG&A line. And I am just -- I want to confirm that -- is that accurate and is that reflected in the $52.2 million ex-impairment SG&A line?
Michael Milligan:
Yes, there's 50 -- exactly. There is incremental $4 million in there, which included the SG&A piece and incremental legal and deal related costs.
Unidentified Analyst:
Which will be considered non-recurring going forward?
Michael Milligan:
Yes, that's right.
Unidentified Analyst:
And where we should tax like that it say 34%, 35%. So that's about $0.08 hit to the $0.35 set number that you reported as adjusted?
David Storch:
It sounds right.
Unidentified Analyst:
Okay. So really true earnings power in the quarter is closer to the $0.43 than the $0.35, correct? If one were to...
David Storch:
If you backed out the exceptional items, it is correct.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Larry Solow.
Lawrence Solow:
Just to confirm on Brad's question, didn't you already -- you already I thought backed out a portion of that, right? The $2.6 million impairment. So it's only the $1 million, right? When you restate while you're backing out the entire $54.2 million charge, right? Included in that was $2.6 million in SG&A, right? So you adjusted for that already in your $0.35, if I am not mistaken? You only thing you didn't adjust for as the $1 million in legal fees, but the other portion of it unless I'm mistaken. Hello?
David Storch:
So the answer to the run rate -- so what you say is we would add another $0.03 to the $0.38 or $0.41.
Lawrence Solow:
$0.38 or $0.35?
David Storch:
$0.38. So you got the $0.35, the $0.03 what we're indicating is the losses at the business. And another $0.03 on top of that for the one-off exceptionals in the SG&A.
Lawrence Solow:
So the $3.6 you referred to in the press release, and just to clarify, and sorry to be annoying but Brad [ph] that's a very good question. The $3.6 you referred to in the text is actually included in the $52.2 million. And then you break out an additional $2.6 million, is that right?
David Storch:
$2.6 million of the $3.6 million is included in the impairment.
Lawrence Solow:
Right. Okay, so that's in the $2.6 million, you already backed out? You backed out the $54 million or whatever the total -- right. So it's only the $1 million that you haven't already backed out? Okay. That's right?
David Storch:
That's right.
Operator:
And I'm showing no further questions at this time.
David Storch:
Larry, just to be clear. So it's $1 million plus another $400,000 that we indicated. So it's $1.4 million or $1.3 million that gets you to the $0.03, okay? Next question?
Operator:
I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time.
End of Q&A:
David Storch:
Okay. Thanks everyone and have a happy holiday. Be well. Bye-bye.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to AAR's Fiscal Year 2018 First Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Holmes, President and COO; Mike Milligan, Vice President and CFO and Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017. In providing forward-looking statements, the Company assumed no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch:
Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us here today. With me in Chicago we have, Mike Milligan, who joined the Company September 1st. Mike is our new CFO, and he'll introduce himself a little further in this presentation. Very excited to have Mike join the team and counting on great things coming from Mike in his -- as he gets familiarize himself with our industry and the Company. He's off to a good start and working very closely with Tim Romenesko. Tim, as we discussed before, also here with me in Chicago will be retiring December 31st and I can't say enough good things about Tim. He's just been a real strong force here at the Company and a great business partner to many of us here. And although he will be retiring, he will still stay engaged with the Company from [MLV] or post his retirement. Also here is John Holmes. John, as you recall, was named President and Chief Operating Officer effective June 1, and he recently joined our Board. So very strong team here, and we’ll all be available to answer any questions that may come as a result of our opening comments. Now, turning back to the quarter. As you can see, we had solid first quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased nearly 11% from $0.28 last year to $0.31 in the current period. First quarter sales were up 8.5% for the quarter with sales within Aviation Services slightly above our long term target of 5% to 10% growth. The growth was even more impactful when taking into consideration the wind down of the KC-10 program, which contributed $26.9 million, less than the prior year sales. We were especially pleased with the performance of our industry leading integrated supply chain businesses. And during the quarter, we announced significant new business wins to this group of businesses, including a long-term contract awarded to us by Hawaiian Airlines to support their new Airbus neo aircraft. We’ve had a long-term and longstanding relationship with Hawaiian, and very excited to expand this relationship to support their new fleet of 18 A321neo's, a very exciting airplane for them and a very exciting program for us, get's us on to new technology Airbus platform. And we're very excited about those prospects. We’re also awarded a long term contract to provide comprehensive flight-hour component support for 100 new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft with flydubai, which is expected to commence in October 2017. This is our second significant supply contract with flydubai. You may recall, last year, we announced the PBH program for 60 737neo’s in support of flydubai. We're very excited to grow our business with them as they’ve proven to be a successful regional carrier and the first MAX operator in the Middle East. So both of these contracts are meaningful in relationship to deepening our relationships with both of these important customers, but also meaningful in terms of providing an entrée for us to support these newest generation aircraft, which have had good successes in terms of sales rates coming both from Airbus for their version, which is the A320 family and for Boeing in their 737 family. Lastly, during the quarter, our aviation services businesses received a notice to proceed on the 15 year $900 million Landing Gear Performance-Based Logistics One program with U.S. Air Force, which we had previously announced. For this program, we're providing total supply chain management, including inventory logistics and repair services to support the Air Force requisitions received in support of all their C-130, KC-135 and E-3 landing gear requirements. And this program is expected to commence next April. Finally, earlier today, you may have seen that we announced the acquisition of two MRO businesses from premier aviation in Canada. Simultaneous with this acquisition, we announced the new long-term contract with Air Canada for airplane maintenance on their narrow-body fleet and their regional fleet of aircraft. These airframe maintenance services will be performed in our newly acquired Canadian facilities. The total value of this contract is approximately CAD500 million. This is not all incremental because we are currently doing business with Air Canada, and we’ll know shortly we’ll be able to communicate shortly what the impact is in terms of growth. But it’s a nice increase in business with Air Canada. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Mike so he can give you a little bit more color on our financials. So Mike?
Mike Milligan:
Great, thanks David. Good afternoon everybody. It’s a pleasure to be here today. I recently joined AAR on September 1st after more than 30-years of financial experience in both public accounting and industry. Most recently, I was a CFO of a large private equity owned equipment rental company that was purchased by the industry leader back in April. I am excited and impressed with the AAR team at all levels and feel that the Company is well positioned for growth in the future. And I look forward to working out with all of you in the coming periods. I’ll run through a few of the comments on the Company's first quarter '18 financial performance. Then we can move to Q&A. As you can see in the release, we experienced strong sales growth in the quarter, up to $439 million, up 8.5% or $34 million from the same period in the prior year. These increases were driven by strong performance of our Aviation Services segment. Sales at the Aviation Services segment increased $37 million or 11% year-over-year, and the related gross profit increased $4.4 million or 8% for the current quarter. Notwithstanding how good we feel about the results, it should be noted that the operating income was down slightly year-over-year. In this year's results, we incurred $1 million of non-recurring costs and in last year's results we recognized $2.6 million gain from the sale of a product line in expeditionary services. Normalizing our performance would show 20% increase in operating results year-over-year. Consolidated net income was up 11.5% to $10.6 million year-over-year. Our income tax was favorably impacted in the quarter by adapting new amended accounting standard for stock-based compensation. That impact was $1.2 million favorable amount. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.2 million and depreciation and amortization for the same period was $14.6 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $2.6 million or $0.75 per share. We repurchased 142,600 shares in the quarter at $5.2 million. Our average diluted share count for the quarter was $34.5 million compared to $34.2 million in the prior year, and reflected increases of option exercises and additional grants offset by the reduction of more than 600,000 shares that were repurchased year-over-year. With that, I'll kick it back over to David.
David Storch:
Thanks Mike. And once again, welcome to the Company and great job there. Appreciate it. I’ll just end by saying, I'm sure you recall that historically first quarter is relatively soft quarter to compared to others; and that the airlines have most aircraft to flying; demand is pretty high in the summer months. And historically, this has been a softer quarter than other quarters, but still nice increase over the prior year. And I feel good about the progress we’ve made during the quarter. I feel good about the acquisition that we announced this morning. But mostly, I feel really good about our leadership team and the momentum this team is generating as we come into the second quarter of our fiscal year. So with that, thanks for joining us. And we’ll open it up for any questions you might have.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Larry Solow.
Larry Solow:
Thanks. First off, just want to wish Tim best of luck. It's been a pleasure to work with you for last 11 years…
Tim Romenesko:
Thanks Larry.
Larry Solow:
Yes, absolutely. And then welcome to the Company Mike, and we look forward to continuing the relationship. But just first question, just on the Aviation Services, obviously, a really good quarter, I think it's like 20% -- 21% growth excluding the KC-10 loss, which we’re aware of. Was that program -- the programs biz and the distribution business have been growing like gain-busters as evidenced by your aircraft under contract in last year, the growth there. But did the distribution -- the trading parts business and the MRO businesses also pick up a little bit to help drive that growth. It’s a pretty good growth…
Mike Milligan:
The trading sales were up $22 million or 42% and the commercial programs were up over $18 million.
Larry Solow:
So trading obviously did have an impact. Is that bump up -- was there anything in there that’s sort of unusual or anything or…
John Holmes:
No. This is John Holmes. It's not unusual. We’ve had a nice recovery, I'll call it, over the last five or six quarters in the trading business. And volume, both for engine and airplane parts has actually been quite consistent over that period of time.
Larry Solow:
And then with that pretty good growth and then obviously the drop off of KC-10, which was -- from my understanding, much lower margins. You did call out the $1 million in non-recurring cost. But on that, the gross margin line with just great growth still down, anything else in there mix wise or anything that was unusual or any thoughts on that?
John Holmes:
Not anything unusual.
Larry Solow:
So I mean is that the step down in gross margin was that due to those onetime costs or is it just little bit of surprise that you can grow 20% outside of a business that was probably not very profitable, but yet your gross margins year-over-year came down?
John Holmes:
Yes, it was due to those onetime costs. We had some restructuring in one of our businesses that resulted in some severance. And then we also had some customer movement in our MRO business that incurred some costs as we moved transition customers from one facility to another.
Larry Solow:
Got it. And then just last question on the purchase from Premier. Those facilities, were they -- obviously, Air Canada, you’re going to -- sounds like you’re going to bring their existing work out today plus the incremental to that facility. Are those facilities serving other customers? Is there other revenue and utilization going on there, and as the transition goes to you guys?
John Holmes:
Yes. There is existing revenue there. The two facilities -- one of the facilities is full of other customers in addition to Air Canada, which we mentioned that the Air Canada E-Jet work is being done in the one facility already today along with other customers. We plan to work with the existing customers to transition them either to the other Premier facility or other of ARR facilities as the A320 portion of the Air Canada work is pulled up.
Operator:
Your next question comes from the line of Ben Klieve.
Ben Klieve:
So couple of questions for you. First of all, to building off the discussion in the MRO facilities that you described. I'm wondering what if any impact will be on your existing U.S. based facilities? Are you anticipating any shipping business from the U.S. up towards those Canadian facilities? How do you see that playing out?
John Holmes:
No, no. If anything, it could be the office that where we think some of the work that exists there and move it to another one of our U.S. based facilities. But nothing from the U.S. will migrate to Canada.
David Storch:
So this contract is not about moving and the acquisition is not about moving work or jobs outside the United States. In fact, this is purely around capturing business in the Canadian marketing and retaining business they currently do. But we're looking at this as a way to bolster our presence in the North American market, strengthen our position here in North America, which obviously is mostly U.S. based.
Ben Klieve:
And then with those facilities, is the workforce that’s there, is there any meaningful gain in representation?
David Storch:
No.
Ben Klieve:
And you said at neither facility?
John Holmes:
Neither facilities…
Ben Klieve:
And I guess last question on that is the timing. David, you said that there would be some more information coming out about the -- what would be incremental growth above your existing relationships. Do you guys know roughly when you think we're going to find out more about the specifics on the revenue, and when the revenue is going to begin ramping?
David Storch:
We should be able to share that information in a week and half or 10 days. So at the end of next week, I think, we’ll have that information for you.
Operator:
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Maybe just to stay on that Premier. What was the rationale for us and wanting to sell those businesses, those facilities?
David Storch:
Well, you had a private owner, a entrepreneur. He was getting to an age where he’s looking to retire and lessen his burden, if you will. The businesses were growing; and I think if the timing was right for him and it was for us and it was for Air Canada. So I think you can see there is a connection between the acquisition and the contract signing with Air Canada. And I think he was helpful in making all that happen.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Was this a competitive process, was anyone else interested, or was this more of exclusive with just you guys?
David Storch:
I can't say that. You never know the things are 100% wise. I mean, we felt we had a good -- we've had a long standing relationship with Air Canada. Air Canada introduced us to these folks, and there may have been others. But I can't tell you that there were, or there weren't, I don’t know.
Michael Ciarmoli:
And then just -- I think you guys also had maybe an announcement, I think it might have been late August. You got an exclusive deal with AMETEK to distribute some of their military related content. Can you just elaborate on -- I think you've got a couple of these exclusive deals on the distribution side. What are you guys bringing to the table that you're landing these contracts versus some of the other distributors out there? Why are some of these OEMs choosing you guys?
David Storch:
Thanks for the question. Growing that distribution business has been a big part of our strategy for the last few years. And we've seen a lot of lot of success in capturing exclusive distributorships, just like the AMETEK deal. I'd say the value proposition for us, relative to our two largest competitor AVL and Satair is our independence and our channels to market. So with the growth of the Power-by-the-Hour business, with the growth of the MRO business, we have a number of touch points with the customers that allow us to push the OEM’s product in a way that our competitors may not be.
Michael Ciarmoli:
And then just last one, I'll ask more of a bigger picture on the market; Boeing pushing for their services entrée into the services market; they've got some pretty ambitious goals. Have you guys seen anything? I mean, is there an opportunity for you guys to partner with Boeing? Is it more of a risk maybe as it relates to all the different aspects of your aviation businesses from the distribution, the integrated services supply chains? What color can you provide around what Boeing is or what you're seeing in the marketplace with Boeing?
David Storch:
So Boeing, of course, is a very different company than AAR. And Boeing has made some noise about looking at the in the avionics industry in a way that they haven't in the past, largely due their interest in capturing more aftermarket activity. And I believe you've seen the UTC Collins transaction. I believe that Boeing, our relationship with Boeing today, is their supplier, their customer and their competitor. They were a competitor on the flydubai transaction. And I'm sure they will win some competitions and there'll be a good competitor. But nevertheless, I think we offer speed, customer familiarization, a broader product line offering in that we can support not just your Boeing fleet but also your Airbus and Bombardier and Embraer fleet. And this is our core fundamental business. We understand and particularly around maintenance, we understand have a get aircraft in and out hangers quickly and safely. On the supply chain business, we understand how to value inventories in ways that might be a little tougher for somebody like Boeing. Plus as I indicated, we go across the different platforms and aren’t Boeing centric or Airbus centric, but can really focus on the customer and their solution set. So we don't believe that their interest in the aftermarket is necessarily competitive to our interest. But time will tell. We feel good about our positioning.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Last one, INL contract. Are we still on track for October 31st, or we’d hear something sooner?
David Storch:
October 31st should be the latest date and also we might hear something sooner, but should be no later. As of today, no later than October 31st.
Operator:
Your next question comes from the line of [Stan Mayer].
Unidentified Analyst:
I have a question on a contract that I don't think you've mentioned, so I'd like to get some clarity on. The contract with the State Department the big contract, is that going to start in this fiscal?
David Storch:
Yes. So Stan, the last question was around the INL contract, which is the state department contract. It is under a -- still under a protest. The first protest we succeeded at the GAO level, the encumbence then perceived through the U.S. government on their decision at the Court of Federal Claims. The case is currently at the Court of Federal Claims. And they will be decision rendered on October 31, or sooner. But we have not begun work. We are hopeful that the decision will be in our favor as all the previous decisions have been. And that we would be receive and know this to commence work shortly thereafter.
Unidentified Analyst:
So still in the pipeline…
David Storch:
Yes.
Unidentified Analyst:
Use of cash, David. Can you give us your priorities for kind of priorities…
David Storch:
So Stan, similar to the past, we’re very focused on growing the business. So we're investing in the business. We discussed in this call couple of contracts, the flydubai contract and the Hawaiian contract, as well as you’ve followed the Company over the years, other contracts, we've recently received in supporting the inventory needs of airlines around the world. And these contracts have appeared where they require investment. And so we get -- start taking cash flows in return. We will continue to look for ways as we have with this acquisition of Premier to enhance the Company, enhance our value proposition. And under the belief that we're strengthening our product offering in a way that makes us more valuable over time. So our first priority remains investing in the business -- and then we’ll look for ways to get capital back to our shareholders as we’ve also demonstrated over the last three to four years. So we've given back through share repurchase and dividends about $250 million. And we have a recent reauthorization -- share repurchase authorization, I should say by the Board that refreshed our last authorization, which was $250 million worth of our stock. And we will, from time-to-time, be returning capital in that fashion.
Unidentified Analyst:
Your cash flow with the premier -- you're currently using your full cash flow, but not liquidity?
David Storch:
Yes. So our liquidity is -- we have a healthy liquidity position in excess of $300 million, and we’ll be financing the premier transaction with a specific piece of Canadian dollar based financing. And so our liquidity remained strong. We are investing in the business on Q1. We were a net investor, a net consumer of cash, I should say. And we would expect that through the balance of the year we’ll be a net generator of cash.
Unidentified Analyst:
Last question and probably may have no impact on you at all, but the United Tech Rockwell Collins acquisition. How does that change either your planning, your strategy, your priorities? What affect will it have on AIR, if any?
David Storch:
So we're very cognizant on the transaction. We do business with both Unite Technologies and Collins. We don’t anticipate that those relationships -- we're not anticipating any change in relationship. We’re a little bit tighter with UT than we would be with Collins. So if anything, hopefully, the UT management will encourage Collins to do more business with us. So as we sit here today, we view it neutral to potentially positive.
Unidentified Analyst:
Collins was your father-in- laws first account?
David Storch:
Yes, it was true…
Unidentified Analyst:
Everything goes in circles. Anyway, thank you. Good job.
Operator:
There are no further questions at this time.
David Storch:
Okay. Well, thank you so much for your participation today. Hopefully, you're pleased with the results as we are. And look forward to the next time we convene. Thank you.
Operator:
This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal Year 2017 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; John Holmes, President and Chief Operating Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch:
Thank you very much and welcome everyone. Good afternoon. I hope everybody’s having a good day and thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and year-end fiscal year 2017 results. As you can tell by the release early today, we had another solid quarter as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 29% from $0.34 in the prior year to $0.44 in the current period. Revenue was up 5.1% or 23.7 million for the quarter primarily as a result of increased sales in our Aviation Services segment to commercial customers, partially offset by the wind down of the KC-10 program, which Tim will talk a little bit further about in his comments and our Lake Charles airframe maintenance facility which we’ve discussed in the past. We’re especially pleased with the performance of our industry-leading integrated supply chain solutions and our aircraft and parts supply activities. During the quarter, we announced significant new business wins including the $909 million fixed-price contract from the U.S. Air Force for the Landing Gear PBL. Under the contract, we will provide total supply chain management, including purchasing, remanufacturing, distribution, and inventory control to support the Air Force requisitions received for all C-130, KC-135, and E-3 landing gear parts. Performance on the contract is on hold pending resolution of a protest filed by one of the competitors for the contract. We were also awarded a multi-year component support contract with ASL Group, a growing European-based scheduled and charter carrier. The new contract for Power-by-the-Hour support for ASL Group’s airlines includes component support and repair for approximately 100 passenger and cargo aircraft, including the ATR aircraft. And we identify the ATR aircraft in this respect because we also acquired a small little business from them to support ATR aircraft and we’re excited about the possibilities for that product line. AAR will support contract with inventory purchase from ASL subsidiary, ACLAS Global, which will be incorporated into AAR's existing global supply chain network located in Belgium, Germany, and Singapore. We were also awarded a multi-year component support agreement with Viva Colombia and Viva Air Peru. AAR will be providing full support to affiliate airlines within the Viva Latin America group including Viva Colombia, Colombia’s first low-cost carrier, and the newly established low-cost carrier Viva Air in Peru. AAR will make inventory available from its facilities in Miami and Chicago, as well as positioning stock in Bogota, Medellin, and Lima. We are very excited to expand our presence in Latin America with this new contract. We’re continuing with the growth in our integrated supply chain solutions and now supporting approximately 1,400 aircraft new aircraft platforms. We’re also continuing to expand geographically most recently opening offices in India and New Zealand that position us closer to our customers. We believe that our closer to customer business model remains a strategic advantage for the company. Before handing the call over to Tim, I would like to take a minute to provide an update on the INL/A contract award to AAR Airlift by the U.S. State Department back in September 2016. We expect a decision by the United States Court of Federal Claims by October 21 regarding the protest and we remain favorably inclined as a result of our expectations for the outcome from this latest protest effort. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Tim to discuss the financials in a bit more detail. I may have said October 30 for October 31, 2017; so apologies on that.
Tim Romenesko:
Thanks, David. As David mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter with sales of $492 million and earnings per share of $0.44 compared to $0.34 in the prior year. Sales in the quarter grew 5% driven by growth in both segments and this is despite higher sales of 32.8 million in the prior year quarter related to the wind down of the KC-10 contract and the Lake Charles facility. I’m going to give you the quarterly sales on the KC-10 contract that we had in fiscal '17 for your modeling. Sales in the first quarter were 38.6 million, 29.4 million in the second quarter, 24.3 million in the third quarter, and 18.3 million in the fourth quarter for a total of 110.6 million in fiscal '17. And in fiscal '18, we expect minimal KC-10 revenue. Gross profit increased 10.3 million for the quarter in the Aviation Services segment on increased sales volumes and margins in parts supply and commercial programs. Gross profit in the Expeditionary Services segment increased 3.9 million with improved profitability across these businesses. SG&A expenses increased in Q4 reflecting several special items including increased legal fees related to INL, acquisition diligence costs and compensation costs including some severance. These special costs were approximately 4 million in the quarter. Consolidated net income was up 3.3 million in the quarter and our results included a $2.2 million reduction in income tax expense related to the recognition of previously reserved income tax benefits. This item helped to offset some of the increase in the SG&A expense that we experienced related to the special items. CapEx in the quarter were $5.6 million and depreciation and amortization was $13.9 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of 2.9 million or $0.075 per share and we repurchased 96,000 shares for 3.2 million in the quarter. And for the year, we repurchased 767,000 shares for 19.8 million. Our average diluted share count for the quarter was 34.3 million compared to 34.2 million in the fourth quarter last year. And as David mentioned, yesterday our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our stock. And just a couple of comments on the full fiscal year. Our earnings per share was $1.45 compared to $1.10 in fiscal 2016, so up a healthy 32% for the year. Sales grew 4% for the fiscal year to 1.767 billion, driven by sales growth in both segments. And again, this reflects overcoming $80 million in higher sales in the prior year from KC-10 and Lake Charles. Gross profit increased 18.4 million in the fiscal year in Aviation Services segment and 22.2 million in Expeditionary Services segment. Net debt increased 30.1 million for fiscal 2016 as we continued to make strategic investments in our business, including assets to support new multi-year supply chain management programs supporting our customers as well as for dividends and share repurchases. So thanks again for your interest. Now I’ll turn the call back over to David.
David Storch:
We completed our Board meetings this morning. We’ve had two days of productive Board meetings as you can see from some of our announcements. I’m pleased to announce that John Holmes was elected a Board member and you should know that John is off to a very strong start as our President and Chief Operating Officer. We also announced the hiring of Mike Milligan to be our new Chief Financial Officer. Mike will join the company on September 1. He will have tough shoes to fill with Tim’s retirement but Tim will hang around for the end of the calendar year to give ample of time for him to share with Mike some of his knowledge and make the transition a little bit smoother. So I would like to at this moment thank Tim for his 36 years of service to the company and his valued counsel. But I’m pleased to know that he will be the company full time through the end of the year and then will stay on as a consultant into next year for the full calendar year. So all-in-all, our company finished up with a very strong year. We go into the new year with a fair amount of momentum; feel very good about some of the skill sets that we’ve developed this past year and feel good about the investments we made to fund our future growth. With that, I’d like to turn the call back to you folks to see if there’s any questions you might have that we might be able to answer.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.
Larry Solow:
Great. Thanks. Really, a good quarter. Can you just give us – it looks like obviously a lot of these new supply chain contracts are really helping in the Aviation Services, even 5% growth with the KC-10 loss. Could you just tell us what the Q4 '16 was for KC-10 so we know how much sales you lost year-over-year in the quarter? Do you have that number?
David Storch:
Yes, just one second. Let’s see if we can get it real quick. It’s 41 million.
Larry Solow:
Okay. So it would have been obviously much better growth. I guess a few questions around that. Your aircraft under contract in the supply chain are up almost 50% year-over-year I think. I realize that’s only a third of Aviation Services. I know there are also some puts and takes there too. But I guess that should support a pretty good – is it fair to say – Dave, you’ve sort of not given guidance for this but you’ve always sort of targeted a mid-to-high single-digit top line growth in the Aviation Services. Is that a fair outlook for '18 or maybe a little backend loaded as you got to get through some – a little higher KC-10 sales earlier in the year but how do you look at that?
David Storch:
Yes, I think we can say with – what we shared in the past, I think 5% to 10% range is a range we’re comfortable with.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And Lake Charles, are you guys completely out of that now? Is there any residual expenses related to that or you’ve sort of exited that completely?
David Storch:
Yes, by the end of this quarter.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And then how is the ramp up I guess at the other MRO facilities? Is that happening a little offset – a little bit of the shift ongoing too, right?
David Storch:
Yes, so as you know, the summer months are weaker months from a maintenance standpoint because the airplanes are flying. But we’re setting ourselves up to have another pretty decent year for MRO and we feel we have pretty good alignment that we’re looking at in terms of customers and facilities. And we’ve brought the Rockford facilities online now. It’s doing work. It was profitable in the Q4 period and we’re kind of excited about what the prospects might be for that as well.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And on the Expeditionary side, it sounds like obviously we’re all waiting for the INL decision, but outside of that I guess the Airlift, it sounds like maybe you’ve lost a little bit more positions there? And then how about mobility, maybe that’s doing a little better?
David Storch:
Mobility is doing a little bit better. Airlift, you’re correct. We’ve lost some positions. But the mobility business has seen a little bit more order flow, so not where it’s been but better than recent past.
Larry Solow:
Right. It seems like for a few quarters at least it’s showing a little bit – maybe a little stability there at least hopefully.
David Storch:
Yes.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And just for housekeeping, I know you basically had a $0.06 benefit on the lower income tax and then I know you called out this 4.1 million total which it sounds like it’s basically a bunch of nonrecurring stuff, the biggest piece being legal. And is it all related to INL or is there some other stuff in there?
David Storch:
The legal is 98%. It’s mostly related to that.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And I guess obviously that could go on another quarter or two hopefully if things go your way at October 31, it’s anybody’s guess at this point or – how long can it go on, right? I don’t know if you have an answer to that.
David Storch:
We’re technically an intervener in DynCorp’s lawsuit against the U.S. government, and we will continue to spend money in that role and hopefully the process will conclude by the October 31 date. We won’t expect much in the way of legal expense after that unless Dyncorp continues to protest.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And just last question, I know you put out your new authorization approval – a pretty large authorization. I realize there’s no timeframe but it seems like you’ve talked a lot – you’ve through the years returned a lot of cash to shareholders. It sounds like that will continue. Do you feel more ambitious to repurchase more shares? I know you’ve been a little bit slow on that front?
David Storch:
No, I think we’re – the strategy is no different than it’s been. What we were looking to do was kind of replenish the authorization. We have had a $250 million authorization back in '2014 and we went to about – maybe that was '15 actually. But we went through 187 million of it. To give us the maximum flexibility, the Board thought wise to go ahead and bring it back up to the old -- to the level it was before. No change though in terms of motivation or outlook in this regard. And obviously, we don’t buy shares in as a strategy, we buy shares in opportunistically as we see fit.
Larry Solow:
Understood, great. I appreciate it. Thanks, Dave.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn:
Hi, everybody.
David Storch:
Hi, Rob.
Robert Spingarn:
So I guess if we do the math on that that was just discussed between the tax and the SG&A, you did, I don’t know, $0.49, $0.50 in the quarter. Is that about right? Tim, would that be the --
Tim Romenesko:
Yes, we had – the benefit from the taxes were a little less than the after-tax impact of kind of the special.
Robert Spingarn:
Yes, I was thinking like $0.06 and $0.10 for two items, something like that. Okay. So, David, if you’re running around this $0.49, $0.50 here just to get an idea of what your earnings power is if you adjust for anything in the quarter that’s nonrecurring or maybe seasonal or what have you? If you think about the aftermarket Aviation Services as we go forward here in the various businesses, you’ve already touched a little bit on supply chain and on MRO. And then if we think about Expeditionary, its run rate ex-INL, is this the right earnings power or would you say it’s a little higher, a little lower as we go forward here?
David Storch:
Yes, what I’d like to – first of all, fourth quarter is historically a strong quarter. So you have airlines getting ready to service their customers for the summer months, so you have the – shops are pretty full and the spare parts supply is pretty robust. So that’s been a trend for the last 15, maybe 20 years here as a company. What I would like to do, Rob, is we have our Investor Day in October. We’ll be coming out with a date here pretty soon. What I’d like to do is kind of give you – share at that point a little bit more feel for how we see the trend, if you will, in the business. Right now we feel pretty bullish on things but I just want to let a couple of time pass, let John get a little bit more ensconced in his position. And then by around October we should be able to give a little bit more color.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. I’ve asked you in the past, we’ve had this – I don’t want to accelerate things for you, David, but I get the impression that you’re kind of getting to that point where you’re about $0.50 a quarter even if this fourth quarter was a little bit call it seasonally strong. And it’s not an unreasonable way to think about the future maybe adjusting a bit for seasonality. Is that a fair --?
David Storch:
Yes.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. While I have you here, just on the authorization, were you intending to release that during market hours today or is that supposed to come out tonight?
David Storch:
We released it – when we released it we were putting together our minutes from the Board meeting and we just released it as part of the normal course of business. So we got the authorization yesterday during the day. It was something we meant to get out last night, didn’t get around to it and we got it written up this morning during our session with the Board and got it out today. So we weren’t thinking about after hours or before hours.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. With INL and I know you can’t quantify yet until this thing is decided but we’re all thinking about it if you win it, it’s additive. Are there any negative considerations from a management perspective or bandwidth vantage point that we should take into consideration just given the significance of this contract if and win it starts to contribute?
David Storch:
Not that we’ve seen, nothing that is a parent but I guess I would reserve my comments on that until after the actual execution. But nothing that is a parent.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then the last thing I want to ask you is if we can run through the Aviation Services businesses on a more individual level, talk about maybe with some more clarity what the growth is there in each of those pieces and how you think about that at least somewhat qualitatively going forward? So what’s driving the strength right now? Is it the supply chain contracts? Obviously you’ve said that MRO right now is a little bit lighter because the aircraft are in use. How do we think about these sub businesses in 2018 from a growth perspective, revenue?
David Storch:
So let me share with you how we’re thinking about the businesses because we’re really thinking about the businesses as being integrated and having an integrated solution. So as we think about our strategy, we think about these pieces and how they’re connected to each other. And as we think about growing the company, we think about growing them in this fashion. So at this stage I would prefer to focus more around thinking of these businesses as a collective group of businesses designed to give us a powerful value proposition for our customers. And I believe that that strategy is working and I don’t think at this stage it would be wise to deviate from that. So I’d prefer to speak in terms of the businesses in their totality.
Robert Spingarn:
Let me ask you this if I can, I don’t want to pry but I think you said earlier – somebody said earlier Aviation Services gross should be in the 5% to 10% range if I caught that right. Are you then saying that each of the businesses should track that way or not necessarily? They could be far different within that but the aggregate is 5% to 10%?
David Storch:
Yes, right. I’m saying the aggregate is 5% to 10%. Yes, that’s what I’m saying.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Can you give us a hierarchy of growth among the three these days?
Tim Romenesko:
I’m just going to keep trying but --
David Storch:
So we’ll drill down a little bit further at the Investor Day, so why don’t we kind of wait on that until then and leave it at that.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay, all right. Thank you very much.
David Storch:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Klieve from Noble Capital Markets.
Ben Klieve:
All right. Thank you. A few questions for me. First, a couple on the INL award. First, correct me if I’m wrong but is that legal decision that you expect on October 31, is that a bit later than you previously expected? I think I remember that you were looking at August or September earlier but I could be --?
David Storch:
The last date was August 9. We then went out with a 8-K filing and laid out the dates between now and October 31, so there was a delay in the process and we articulated that through a way in the 8-K filing.
Ben Klieve:
Got you. I just missed the K then. Okay. Thanks for that. So sticking with the INL, given the prolonged nature of the protest and multiple ongoing litigations that you guys have had to deal with, have you been able to speak ultimately with the customers you can kind of reasonably plan for the ramping of this award or have those communications been – maybe not shutdown but maybe minimized that would prevent you from kind of ramping that up pretty quickly once this is resolved?
David Storch:
Shutdown.
Ben Klieve:
Shutdown, okay. I guess do you anticipate then because of them, because of the way that this will maybe take another – that the ramp will take a little bit longer than you’d previously hoped?
David Storch:
No. We would be hopeful that we could get on schedule on the ramp. We’ve had enough time to think about it. So we’re pretty prepared. We’re pretty prepared.
Ben Klieve:
All right. Next, I was wondering if you could provide any context around the timing of the protest on the Air Force Landing Gear awards. Do you have any visibility for that?
David Storch:
We have reason to believe that a decision will be known before the month is out. So we’re hopeful that we’ll hear something on that before July 31.
Ben Klieve:
Perfect, very good. And then this may be a question that you’d like to discuss on your Investor Day but I’m wondering you talked a bit about the strength in the mobility business and some weaker – a bit of softness out of the Airlift side. I’m wondering if you can just provide a little bit of context as to what you’re seeing from both those businesses and any thoughts than can help us think about how those two businesses are going to perform in '18.
David Storch:
So on the mobility, we’re seeing an increase in dialogue around opportunities with the customers, some new product development actually as well as some of the traditional products. On the Airlift, we’ve won some – we’ve been named on some IDIQs but we haven’t won any past quarters. So we’re a little bit – we’re short there in terms of positions as we mentioned earlier in this call. So again, I think we can get into a lot deeper – more deeper dive at the October Investor Day.
Ben Klieve:
Okay. Thank you. I look forward to that. And then one final question and then I’ll hop back in queue here. Back to the INL award, do you think that there is any potential for the state to add to the ceiling value on the existing contract at all, or does it seem like that’s pretty set?
Tim Romenesko:
We have no visibility on that.
Ben Klieve:
Okay, very good. Thanks for taking my questions. I’ll jump back in.
David Storch:
Thanks, Ben.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe, David, just to go back to Rob’s line of questioning, I know you mentioned the 5% to 10% Aviation growth and I think in the past, maybe at the last Investor Day, you guys had 5% to 10% at the company level. Obviously Aviation is growing pretty rapidly right now. Should we expect that to decelerate to that 5% to 10%? I’m just trying to get a sense for the growth rate. Is the whole company still expected to grow 5% to 10% as well?
David Storch:
Yes. Tim just laid out for you some of the headwinds we faced with the KC-10 wind down.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Right. And that’s still going to be – that’s going to be roughly a 100 million headwind next year, correct?
David Storch:
That’s right, yes.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. Just thinking about maybe the other headwind, should we expect the level of legal spend, this 4 million, to kind of sustain through next quarter? And basically if this does get resolved sooner obviously but if we don’t hear anything until the end of October, is that sort of a good level of expense that’s going to be sustained and then you’ll have to absorb into the P&L?
David Storch:
We would expect the legal expenses to be lower.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Would be lower, okay, got it. And then just from a margin standpoint, you obviously have this KC headwind but yet the Aviation gross margin is 17.4%. How should we think about once you guys sort of absorb this wind down, is there room for further improvement in that aviation gross margin?
David Storch:
We believe that there’s room for improvement, yes. We believe as we succeed more providing integrated solutions that it not just creates more value for our customer but we also think it creates more value for our shareholders as well.
Michael Ciarmoli:
And should that be – do you expect that gross margin to be flattish or expand next year just given that $100 million headwind or do you not see that as much of an impact into next year?
David Storch:
I think as it relates to next year because of the item you mentioned, I think we’re expecting relatively flat.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Flat, okay, got it. And then maybe just the last one for me, on the share repurchase, I know you said you’d be opportunistic. I think last time you guys did sort of a Dutch auction at – 250 million could theoretically buy maybe 17% or so of the shares outstanding. But how is the Board thinking about funding this? Are we going to see a debt offering here in the near term? I know you’ve had a target leverage ratio out there or target leverage of 3.5 times. But what are the thoughts about funding this buyback?
David Storch:
Yes, so first of all, we and one of the – as you’ve seen me indicate, we have different – we look at the application of capital across a few different possibilities. And one of the possibilities of course is investing in the business itself. So if you look at the year that just ended, we spent money buying inventory to support some of these programs that we’ve recently won. We will maintain a balanced approach based on the cash needed to fund the growth of the business and look at the cash that is available and the ratios that are available to us in terms of EBITDA to debt. We’ll keep surveying that and make determinations based on the share price, based on other uses of our capital as to when the right times to be investing in the stock. We do not expect to have a debt offering or there has been no discussion at all about a debt offering to fund the purchases of the stock. And I want to be careful in not signaling any changes from how we’ve been behaving to-date just that we’re looking to refresh what we had previously authorized and giving the company some flexibility as it relates to applications of capital. So please don’t be expecting anything unusual to take place.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. That’s helpful. I will jump back in the queue. Thanks, guys.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We have a follow-up question from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.
Larry Solow:
If I just can real quick on the profitability of the KC-10, I thought it was at least below average on the – I don’t know, maybe on the gross line. So was that actually accretive to your – in other words I thought maybe losing that, sales would not be – would actually may be accretive to the relative margin I should say?
David Storch:
Let me – my recollection is that it’s slightly – it’s two components to the KC-10. There’s the flight hour piece which is below – you may recall we’re reporting it at zero margin. And then there’s the over and above which have a healthier margin. So my sense is that the gross profit line is probably below our blended rate.
Larry Solow:
Right, okay. And then just lastly, did you give the cash flow from the operations in Q4? You gave the CapEx. I was just trying to figure out what the free cash flow was for the year? And then I guess there’s some working capital I guess still building out inventory.
Tim Romenesko:
Cash flow from operations was 33 million in Q4.
Larry Solow:
Okay.
David Storch:
Larry, did you get that?
Larry Solow:
Yes, I got that. And then just on the outlook, obviously I think somewhat of a high class problem in terms of building inventory purchases to support these contracts, any target for free cash flow? It’s been sort of a little bit all over the board the last few years I know.
David Storch:
Yes, what I’d like to do again here is I’d like to have a chance – in this regard that might have to be a little later than October. I want to have a chance to see the impact of the ramp of all these different contracts, because the pace of ingestion has been pretty rapid here. And the first step for us is to make sure we can satisfy the requirements that the customer has and so we’re making the investments we feel are necessary for that. And now we have to give these programs a chance to ramp and take a look what the ongoing costs are against the revenues that come in. So I’d prefer at this stage to give ourselves a little bit more time to see how that evolves. We have internal targets but I prefer to see how we actually perform before I comment.
Larry Solow:
Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator:
Thank you. Speakers, I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back over to you.
David Storch:
Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you for your participation today and your interest in our company. Have a nice afternoon.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day."

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal Year 2017 Third Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, John Holmes, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Aviation Services. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch:
Thank you, Star and good afternoon. Thanks for all for joining us here today to discuss our third quarter 2017 results. We're pleased with the growth coming from our inventory programs activity, supporting commercial airline and during the quarter we captured several important new contracts. Let me start with Allegiant. Allegiant has a fleet of A320 aircraft, currently 36 with a plan to expand up to 100 and we signed a contract with them to provide power by the hour component support in support of that fleet. Also, SkyWest, we build on our relationship that dates back to the 90s whereby we signed a three-year agreement to provide landing gear overhaul and exchange services for SkyWest. The agreement covers landing gear assembly, subassemblies on fleet of more than 400 Bombardier CRJ aircraft. It's a contract that as an option to expand up to five years. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we signed an agreement with India's largest airline, IndiGo, to provide landing gear overall services on their fleet of A320, which is 49. These will be for full ship sets. The agreement expands both our footprint, the Asia-Pacific region and our relationship with IndiGo. These contract awards build on the momentum from earlier in the year as we were successful winning work across a broad geographic footprint in addition to expanding our customer base and the aircraft fleet type coverage. Last quarter we announced a new five-year contract valued at $125 million with South African Airways to provide power by the hour component inventory, management repair services across their fleet of aircraft. We also previously announced a new long-term contract with Air New Zealand to provide nose-to-tail cost for flight hour notable inventory support for 15 of their fleet of 777. They’ll start providing services under these contracts and are excited about the opportunity that these wins provide to the company. Our geographic reach expanded during the quarter as we opened a parts warehouse at Dubai World Central Airport. The supply chain hub closes the gap between central aircraft components and the growing list of commercial and regional carriers operating in a growing Gulf State region. The warehouse enables us to leverage our partnerships with industry-leading OEM such as Eaton, Unison, Meggitt and Lord to stock the warehouse with a wide array of factory-new parts. So, when an operator has an aircraft as grounded, we can get them the needed part to the aircraft quickly. We're starting to see an uptick in activity around our businesses that are impacted by the government's operational tempo. We've had a pickup in business in our palette throughout the whole fiscal year and that work continues and we're getting noise coming out of the commanders in the Middle East about need for support in the regions there as well. Before we begin our financial recap of the quarter, I would like to give an update on the INL/A Contract awarded to AAR Airlift by the US State Department. The incumbent contract continues to protest the award is currently being heard by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for final resolution and we expect to file decision from the court no later than August 2017. We are highly confident that the court will dismiss the claims made by DynCorp and will stand by the State Department's decision to award AAR the contract. You may recall, we are originally selected by the state on September 1. We cleared the first protest with a ruling by the GAO in December. The lawyers in the COFC case remanded the decision back to the State Department contracting officer who then reaffirmed his decision once again in the selection of AAR as the contract for this contract and as I indicated the ruling is now in front of the COFC and we do expect a ruling before August is out. Now back to Q3 results, we had another solid quarter as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 31% from $0.29 last year and $0.38 in the current period. Revenue was up 8.4% or $34.6 million for the quarter primarily as a result of increased sales in our aviation services segment. We had considerable strength in our supply chain businesses to commercial airlines, partially offset by the downsizing of our Lake Charles facility and a reduction in sales from our phaseout of the KC10 program. So, as we sit here today, overall, we're very pleased with the progress during the quarter and we have strong momentum coming into our fourth quarter and feel really good about our overall positioning in the market. With that, I'd like to turn it over the Tim for a little bit more detail.
Tim Romenesko:
Thanks a lot David. So, I'll give a little bit more detail on the quarter. As David mentioned, we had strong quarter with earnings per share of $0.38 compared to $0.29 last year, which is a 31% increase. Good sales growth, 9.6% growth in aviation services. Income from continuing operations was up by $3.2 million in the quarter. The gross profit increased $4.8 million at aviation services segment due to the increased sales volumes and gross profit in expeditionary services increased $4.9 million with improved profitability across our businesses there. SG&A expenses increased $4.3 million in the quarter reflecting increased legal fees related to the INL program that David talked about as well as investments in other business development activities. Interest expense in the quarter is $1.4 million down a bit from last year, primarily as a result of retirement of some of our convertible notes. CapEx in the quarter was $9.1 million, depreciation and amortization $14.7. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $2.5 million or $0.075 a share and we repurchased approximately 52,000 shares in the open market for $1.7 million. As of the end of the quarter, we had 6.1 million remaining available under our Board authorized share repurchase plan. Our average diluted share count for the quarter was 34.2 million compared to 34.4 million in the third quarter last year. Net debt increased $22.4 million from the second quarter as we continue to make strategic investments in our business, including assets to support our new multi-year supply chain management programs supporting our customers. Thanks again for your interest and I'll turn the call back over to David for concluding comments.
David Storch:
Well done, Tim. Once again good quarter and what I'd like to do now is open up and take questions that you may have out there.
Operator:
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Larry Solow:
Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. David I was wondering if you could or Tim could just help just give us a little more color on the very strong quarter in aviation services. I was expecting a solid quarter, but I thought after last quarter KC10 you might see a little more impact from that. Well perhaps there was, but it looks like maybe some of your other contracts ramped up, but normally is seasonally a little slow quarter to sequentially a pretty nice improvement and obviously a 10% growth with the impact of KC10 and also Lake Charles. So maybe you can just give us a little more color on that.
David Storch:
Lots of strength in the parts businesses across the Board to commercial customers. So, we're getting traction from some of our program wins, but I believe we're doing really good job across all the different businesses in that segment.
Larry Solow:
Is this kind of high single-digit growth even forgetting the KC10 impact which actually would make it even higher maybe as you look out, but is this something you think is sustainable or was there some timing relation anything in this quarter that made it a little bit of an aberration or not?
David Storch:
Nothing that stands out. I think we had a good results throughout the businesses. I think we're starting to benefit from some of the investments we've made and some of the actions we've taken in prior periods. So yeah, I think you can see hopefully continued performance coming from our parts businesses.
Larry Solow:
Great. Excellent. Really strong quarter and then just on the expeditionary services, just a little weaker sequentially. I think I know you get lost a couple positions in Afghanistan, but anything else that does sound like really materialistic sound like that should be hopefully getting better and then obviously until the INL contract comes in, but that's independent of that?
David Storch:
Right. Larry, so there is a lot of noise coming out of the market that is kind of indicative of demand about to come. We haven’t seen it yet, but we're getting a sense that there may be some positive stuff out there for us. Now we've had before, but currently at least there is some noise indicating that there may be some interest in our services.
Larry Solow:
Okay. Great. And just one last question, just on the cost side, did the $1.4 million, I guess that's included in your numbers right. That's like a recent impact or whatever.
David Storch:
Yes.
Larry Solow:
And I know you've incurred some costs for that, just in terms of building up the program, but in terms of legal costs, this is probably higher than the normal run rate I would imaging.
David Storch:
Yes. That's correct. That's correct. We've had legal expenses throughout on this program, but we're pointing it out and that's correct. That's already absorbed in our results
Larry Solow:
And just how about the growth in SG&A still pretty high. I realize you had pretty nice revenue growth, but I think if you take out that charge or that expense, it was still like 8%, 9%. So, close to your revenue growth. Any thoughts on that and is that…
David Storch:
Well, we're very driven to bring our SG&A down to historical levels below 10%. So, we would be happy being in the 9% and 9.5% range. Today we're at 10.6%. If you take out the legal expenses, you get a few basis point reduction, but basically what we're counting on right here is to get some sales growth.
Larry Solow:
Got it. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. I appreciate it.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of SunTrust. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Hey, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just to stay on the topic of legal, do you guys expect that that sort of expense level to continue at least until this decision has been made in that August timeframe?
David Storch:
Yeah, I would say so.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. And then staying on INL, anything obviously early stages of budget planning, looking at Trump's proposals, planning on you really taking the hatchet to the Department of State, I would assume this would be something that would be this level of spend given the importance to order security drug interdiction, is there any concern about the funding level for INL going forward?
David Storch:
We've been led to believe no, but obviously, the current planning is outside of our purview if you will, but we've been led to believe that there will be little to no impact.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. Perfect. And then just on back to that growth in the aviation services, can you guys give any color, certainly you're seeing strength, you mentioned the parts business, are you guys seeing, we've had sort of this deferral of shop visits over the prior years. Are you guys starting to see some of these airline customers start to spend given where fuel prices are or just any color you guys are seeing on the behavioral patterns of your airline customers?
David Storch:
I think what you're seeing from our vantage point is more of a market share grab on our part. You've seen some new wins and growth with new customers. So, I think the spending patterns with our customer base that may be noticeable in that regard. I just think in AAR's case, I think what you're seeing is growth in our market share.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Okay. And what's driving those market share gains and who are you taking the share from?
David Storch:
Well, we made a significant investment in BD capability around this program activity and you're seeing some of the fruits of that effort in energy and I think we're just doing a better job geographic dispersion of our -- the balance of our supply businesses. There's a reason for opening up a plant in Dubai and I think our guys are executing -- our guys and gals are executing beautifully.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Fair enough. And then last one, just any thoughts, Boeing making some pretty aggressive statements about coming into the product support business. I don't know how they're going to get to their targeted revenue levels unless they actually start to buy their way into the aftermarket. Any thoughts on what Boeing's decision to get more aggressive in the product support aftermarket for you guys? Have you seen anything at Boeing or do you view that as a risk and opportunity?
David Storch:
Yes, our relationship with Boeing, which would be similar to some of the other large OEs would be in some cases we compete, in some cases we supply, in some cases, we purchase. So, to date, our relationship with Boeing have not really been impacted by any of their announcements in any meaningful fashion and we would anticipate -- we don't see much in a way of change. We're very cognizant of their statements and we're focused on execution here at the company and expanding our capabilities and continue doing our things. So yes, we're aware of them. We're aware of their ambitions, but yet we've not seen any change in terms of our relationship with them.
Michael Ciarmoli:
Got it. Helpful. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator:
[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of [Ben Cleave of Noble Capital Markets]. Your question please.
Unidentified Analyst:
All right. Thank you. So, couple of questions for you guys. First regarding the pipeline, I am wondering in the past you've kind of alluded to the fact that you want to diversify your expeditionary services business through your pipeline expansion. I'm wondering your existing pipeline right now, if you could kind of give us rough estimate of what you have in aviation services versus expeditionary? And then the expeditionary pipeline, to what degree would that continue to diversify that business?
David Storch:
Well, let me first start by saying that I think what you're seeing in our announcement is a bullish attitude around our aviation service business particularly sporting commercial customers. We also see opportunities supporting government customers and are awaiting hopefully some positive news on a few different fronts that we're working on. In terms of our expeditionary service work last year, you may recall that we expanded with the search and rescue contract down in the Falklands in support of the British MOD and we continue to look for opportunities of that nature pretty much around the globe. Our BD team is working fairly aggressively. I'm not in position today report on any progress per se, but I would be hopeful that a year from now or so that we would have some successful stories to communicate.
Unidentified Analyst:
Okay. Thank you. And with regards to the flurry of activity you've seen over the last couple of quarters with these new contracts, looking into Q4, I am wondering on if you expect any of these contracts to be particularly dilutive or meaningful cash consumers and I am really curious any in particular I am wondering about the South African Airways in fact.
David Storch:
Yes, so we would be hopeful that most of -- in terms of the contracts that we've announced that most of the spend has already taken place. So, we would anticipate positive cash flows coming from those investments. That's said, I wouldn't want to limit us to around new contracts that might be in the pipeline as well. So, we have been growing at fairly significant clip. Some of these programs require capital. Some programs require less capital, but we are to answer your question in terms of the current order book, we would anticipate positive cash flows and then we may be making similar investments if we're successful in another contracts of this nature.
Unidentified Analyst:
Okay. Thank you. And so, I guess along that line then, expect for any potential new awards that come up and it's fair to say that your CapEx spend for Q4 isn't going to be enough kind of legacy $7 million or $10 million.
David Storch:
Yes, I think that's a good way to look at yes.
Unidentified Analyst:
Okay. Perfect. That does it for me. Thank you, guys.
David Storch:
Okay. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Burke of Gabelli. Your line is open.
Shannon Burke:
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.
David Storch:
Hi Shannon.
Shannon Burke:
So just starting with the aviation services segment and the new contract with IndiGo, so did you win this contact away from a competitor or were they currently doing it in house and do you think that your expansion with the Dubai center had anything to do with that?
David Storch:
Yes, so the IndiGo contract is more of a labor contract. So, it's a maintenance contract to support their island gear and that would've been business we won away from competition.
Shannon Burke:
Okay. Great. Thank you so much. And then switching to expeditionary, so could you just go over how many fine positions you had at the end of the quarter versus in 2016?
David Storch:
I think we had 16 at the end of the quarter and I'm not sure what we had in 2016? And we can get back to you on that Shannon. We'll get back to you.
Shannon Burke:
Okay. Great. Thanks so much. And so, is this gross profit level, is that about little under 9%, is that the new run rate level given the number five position under the INL contact comes on or how should we think about that?
David Storch:
Yes, so there is a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter just based on how the other businesses within that segment perform. So, I would say plus or minus where we should be in that range.
Shannon Burke:
Okay. But the Falkland Island contract is still performing well.
David Storch:
It is.
Shannon Burke:
Okay. Great. And then in the mobility business, you said you're seeing some noise. Is there anything that you are seeing in the budget given the recapitalization of military? Is there any prospects you see and then I guess that also goes a long way to what Michael was asking?
David Storch:
Yes, so we haven’t seen the details of the budget related to spend on the type of things we produce. We are seeing an uptick in activity around some of our container product lines and there's noise elsewhere in that business as well, but the influx of orders is -- we've had steady flow, not a huge influx of orders for that business. In terms of the mobility, the airlift business, which is the other part of our expeditionary services, that's where we're seeing noise coming out of the theater from commanders looking for support.
Shannon Burke:
Okay. Great. And would those be the government funded, the government owned company operated contract?
David Storch:
No. And that would be stuff that we would own and that would be in the operational budget of DOD.
Shannon Burke:
Okay. Great. Okay. Thank you so much. That's all I had.
David Storch:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. And as there are no further questions in queue, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Storch for any closing remarks. Sir?
David Storch:
Thank you very much and thank you for your participation today and I wish everybody a nice, a pleasant afternoon. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you, Sir. And thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude your program. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day."

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal Year 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Storch.
David Storch:
Thank you very much and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2017 results. Let me begin by just saying that John Holmes is not here with us in Chicago today. He is out on assignment, trying to make us some money. So, we’ll try to answer questions related to his area more specifically. Before we begin the recap of the quarter, I’d like to say how proud we are to have been awarded the Worldwide Aviation Support Services Contract by the U.S. State Department. We are very pleased that the GAO found no merit to the award protest filed by DynCorp and that stands by the State Departments decision to award AAR the contract. We do believe and we see where DynCorp will be fighting some more on this contract. We feel at this stage it is, as we have along the road, fairly frivolous but we will fight them every way along the way and have a lot of confidence in the State Department’s decision and a lot of confidence in our ability to bring value to the State Department. Now the GAO decision clears the path now for AAR to assume operations and in the coming days we will work with the Department of State to establish a transition plan for INL/A. While we do not have more to share at this point, we expect to be in a position to provide further details of the transition timing, as well as guidance during our next call. Now back to Q2 results. We had another solid quarter as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 35% from $0.26 last year to $0.35 in the current period. Although revenue was down 1.8% or $7.7 million for the quarter as a result of two significant item, one is the KC10 wind down, which we discussed before and secondly to drive more profitability to our MRO operations, we are transitioning our Lake Charles facility from a comprehensive MRO provider to a more limited operation providing principally only painting services. As we continue to expand our MRO foot print early this month, we had our grand opening for Rockford, which is our sixth MRO constructed and designed to allow us to maintain every commercial aircraft up to and including the A380. For those of you not familiar, Rockford is about a 90 minute drive from downtown Chicago, it’s accessible to a very large labor pool and we’re very excited to have this facility here in the state of Illinois. The facility was funded largely by the state and Federal Government and from local bankers and Rockford kicked in as well. We have very favorable lease agreement and we’re very excited to move into the facility and start doing work for new customers. Overall our Aviation Services business have continued to perform well and we captured several important contracts during the quarter. For example, we signed a five-year agreement valued at $125 million to provide power by the hour, component inventory management repair services to South African Airways Technical or SAAT. The agreement with SAAT represents a significant expansion or AAR in Africa and this win was largely due to the effort of our new President of AAR Africa, Cheryle Jackson, who has been working at the company since 2010 and President of AAR Africa in the last year and this is a very meaningful win for the company. The company has a solidified position in Africa last few years, including signing its first power by the hour component inventory management and repair services contract in 2014 with Kenya Airways to support their fleet of 737s. We also entered into a long term contract with New Zealand, Air New Zealand to provide nose-to-tail cost for flight hour notable inventory support covering a wide range of parts on 15 for their 777 fleet, which is – they have 15 777s that they operate. This contract represents AAR’s first power-by-the-hour agreement solely focused on the 777 aircraft and complements our other programs in the Asia-Pacific region. This additional contract also brings our total number of Aircraft under management to over 1300 aircraft. We signaled before we’ve made a significant investment in the BD capability around soliciting for more of this type of work and we expect to be more successful with programs as the year materializes. During the quarter, we also expanded our distribution relationship with Eaton to include certain products manufactured by its Aerospace Group’s fuel and motion control systems division and now includes refueling sub-systems, fuel pumps, door and landing gear actuators, secondary flight control systems, and piece part sub-assemblies. Overall, I’m very pleased with our progress during this period. The INL/A award is very meaningful and we look forward to working closely with the Department of State to improve their operating efficiencies as we have done consistently for other government agencies and their alliance around the world. I’ll now turn the call over to Tim to discuss the financials for the period.
Tim Romenesko:
Thanks, David. I'll discuss our second quarter financial performance in a bit more detail. As David indicated, we had a good second quarter with earnings per share of $0.35 compared to $0.26 in the prior year, which was a 35% increase. Our sales were down slightly as David mentioned due to the KC10 and Lake Charles transitions. Our Expeditionary services business experienced increased revenues of $5.2 million or 7.2% versus prior year, and net income was up by $4.1 million in the quarter. Gross profit in the Aviation Services segment decreased $2.2 million or 3.8%, driven by the lower sales volume and the KC10 program wind down. Gross profit in Expeditionary Services segment increased $9.3 million with improved profitability across both businesses. SG&A expenses in the quarter increased $3.2 million, reflecting increased investments in business development activities. Interest expense for the quarter was $1.1 million, compared to $1.5 million previously in the previous period, primarily as a result of retirement of our remaining convertible notes. CapEx in the quarter was $9.5 million much of that around technology investments across the company, depreciation and amortization was $14.3 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $2.6 million or $0.075 a share and the average diluted share count for the quarter was 34.1 million, compared to 34.6 million in the second quarter last year. As of November 30, we had $67.9 million available under our Board authorized share repurchase plan. And during the quarter, we reduced our net debt by $3.4 million, compared to the first quarter, while continuing to make investments in working capital to fund the sequential sales growth and also invest in assets to support our new programs. Finally, we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit agreement, which extended the maturity of this agreement to November 2021 and modified certain provisions including the elimination of the material adverse change covenant. So, now I’ll turn the call back over to David for final comments.
David Storch:
Thanks Tim, and if I may, just reflecting back on the period and where the company is today and where we are headed, I’m very pleased with our ability to expand our geographic footprint and you saw some of those as evidenced in the contracts we have recently secured. I’m very pleased with the product range. We've gone ahead and expanded the product category, the product types of inventory that we’re selling to our customers and I’m also pleased with the range of customers and the INL/A contract is a significant move for us and to the Department of State and we’re just coming out of the period and feeling really good and entering our second half with a lot of momentum. So with that, let me open it up for any questions.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Larry Solow of CJS Securities.
Larry Solow:
Good afternoon. David you sound, obviously pretty positive taking someone to doing pretty well, just curious on the KC10, is that wind down occurring any faster than you thought or is that sort of in line with your thinking?
David Storch:
No, it is pretty much in line with what we thought. I mean last year was kind of - so what we communicated after we lost the contract with an average of what the business has produced over the prior three-year period and then we recently kind of signaled what it’s performed over the last year and last year was actually one of the stronger year's that we’ve seen in some time. So when you do comparisons year-over-year, there is obviously a negative comparison. So, it will continue to wind down in Q3 and there will be some minor tail in Q4, but very insignificant.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And then just on the Lake Charles case too, I think the shift out just to the painting is, you know you told it would have several quarters, I’m supposed that piece has never actually turned profitable, so maybe it is just an impact on revenue, but not on things like that.
David Storch:
Yes, that’s the way to look at it Larry. So, we took our actions, we have always struggled with profitability there and we just decided once we were able to come online in Rockford as there was no reason to continue chasing that business the way we had been. So, we feel good about that change from earnings efficiency standpoint.
Larry Solow:
Got it. And just on the fully expected not to be able to comment too much on the INL contract, but it sounds like you expect maybe DynCorp is not done yet in terms of protesting or appealing or may not be that easy, you know so we may not know for a little bit on…
David Storch:
No, no, no. Actually let’s, just to clarify that. So the State Department awarded as the contract back on September 1. The GAO reviewed and DynCorp probably filed the protest. That was fully expected. The GAO considered their protest and denied the protest, which in essence starts the process between ourselves and the State. Now at the same time they have further DynCorp can now go to the, what’s it called, the Court of Claims or something like that. Federal court of claims to pursue their claim, but obviously Larry listen, this is an important contract for DynCorp, it’s important from a standpoint of their insolvency from all appearances, and you know they’re going to keep fighting and they’re going to fight until they can't, but I think it’s been pretty clear that the customers made their selection, the GAO and has gone ahead and upheld the customers selection. We feel very confident that our solution set is unique and superior to anything and anybody else can offer. We were able to blend in best practices from across our network of things that we are doing as a company and I think the State Department saw a value and the GAO basically affirmed that. So Dyn is going to continue I believe down a frivolous path and we are fully prepared to defend our position and the work we’ve done and look forward in supporting the State in the way that the State, we believe the state will be very satisfied with their selection when they reflect that a few us through years down the path.
Larry Solow:
Got it. Great. And just lastly, just on expeditionary services outside of that contract, a second consecutive obviously bouncing off to the bottom and far below where it was a few years ago, but nice little improvement if you look sequentially over the last few quarters, is that being driven by it sounds like both segments are improving a little bit, I guess the falcon Islands contract is ramped up, any thoughts on that and on the mobility side would be great, thanks.
David Storch:
Yes, so the mobility business has a little bit of momentum. The airlift business is doing a good job watching our expenses and we created and we share with us while back ago trading operations down there. We've had some success down there with being able to move assets and we’re competing for new positions and we feel pretty good and team is very excited with the win of the INL/A contract as well.
Larry Solow:
Got you. Great thanks. Appreciate it.
David Storch:
Yes.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Shannon Burke of Gabelli and Co.
Shannon Burke:
Hi good evening.
David Storch:
Hi Shannon.
Shannon Burke:
So, just on the Aviation Services decline, it is a touch on Larry's question, how quickly do you expect the decline and the wind down in the KC10 to be offset by new program gains? I know you called that out in the press release, but will it start to pick up?
David Storch:
I would say by the fourth quarter and first quarter you will start seeing the gains from programs offset the losses from KC10 and then once we start the revenue stream from the INL/A we will be right there with whatever sales declines we have from the KC10.
Shannon Burke:
Right, right. Okay. Thank you for that. And then is there any progress on announcement for a Rockford facility tenant or is that still expected to happen in December.
David Storch:
Yes. We are working very hard. December probably at this stage probably not. We've had some drop in work.
Shannon Burke:
Okay.
David Storch:
We performed some maintenance work for a couple of customers. We are in discussion with a few different carriers. We maintain confidence. We don't start paying rent until we have a base load customer. So, we are out there aggressively talking with people. We have hired our first 30 group of mechanics, and we are in the process of interviewing more and we are hoping that we can be up to work as early as the middle of January, may be February with some business. That’s what we are hoping for at this stage.
Shannon Burke:
Okay. And then that would convert into revenue pretty quickly than I’m assuming once again?
David Storch:
Yes.
Shannon Burke:
Okay. And then just on the Expeditionary Services segment with the Trump administration coming in, he is really focused on reducing cost and watching spending in the DOD budget, have you seen any activity from potential customers or what is your viewpoint because this obviously would be a great benefit to AAR.
David Storch:
So my view is that we offer alternative solutions for the government and typically our solutions are lower cost in nature and we’re fairly optimistic that as the needs continue to grow and the pressure comes to contain cost that we’re in a pretty good position. So, it’s a little hard to predict precisely how the behavior will unfold, come January 20, but we think we’re in a good position to benefit at least from the signals that we’re seeing so far.
Shannon Burke:
Okay. Great, thank you so much.
David Storch:
Thank you, Shannon.
Operator:
Speakers I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back over to you Mr. Storch for closing comments.
David Storch:
Well thank you very much and I’d like to wish everybody a very happy holiday and a New Year filled with peace, happiness, and a dose of prosperity. Be well everybody. Take care.

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal Year 2017 First Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and John Holmes, Chief Operating Officer of Aviation Services. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch:
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to discuss our fiscal year first quarter results. As you can see, overall, we had a very good quarter as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 38% from $0.21 last year to $0.29 in the current period. During the first quarter, we ramped up recently awarded programs on our Aviation Services segment and we continue to win significant new business from both our commercial and government customers. And if I may, I'm just going to highlight a few examples of some of our wins in the period. We won contracts from both Enter Air and flydubai to provide power-by-the-hour component inventory management and repair services for more than 70 737 series aircraft. The latter agreement represents a significant expansion of AAR's commercial footprint in the Middle East and brings our total number of aircraft under management to over 1,200. We also signed an agreement with Asiana Airlines to provide landing gear repair services at our Miami Landing Gear facility. Further, we won a contract from CommutAir, which operates on behalf of the United Airlines as part of the United Express, to provide component repair and supply chain services for their fleet of 40 Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft. Our airlift business was awarded 2 additional rotary-wing positions in Afghanistan, and in addition the Military Sealift Command extended our 4 positions providing vertical replenishment services in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific. These awards bring our total contract positions to 21 aircraft as of the end of the quarter. And of course, most significantly, our airlift business also was awarded the Global Aviation Support Services contract for the Department of State air wing, otherwise known as the INL/A program. Our airlift will be responsible for operating, maintaining and provisioning a current fleet of 140 airplanes and helicopters operating around the world. The potential duration of this contract is 11 years, including a 6-month phase-in. The incumbent contractor filed a protest on September 11, and we expect a decision on the protest no later than December 21. At this point, I want to thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the call over to Tim.
Tim Romenesko:
Thanks, David. I'll discuss our first quarter financial performance in a bit more detail. As David indicated, we had a good first quarter. Sales in the quarter were $404.8 million, up 4.7% versus the prior year. Aviation Services sales increased $18.8 million, or 6% year-over-year, while Expeditionary Services segment reported a slight decrease in sales, although up from Q4. Gross profit increased year-over-year for both segments. The gross profit margin in Aviation Services was 16% with a mix of products and services responsible for the increase. In the Expeditionary Services' segment, the gross profit margin was 11.5, reflecting improved profitability in Mobility products. Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 11.1% for the first quarter, compared to 10.3% last year. The SG&A expense run rate is about in line with our expectations, and we expect that the SG&A as a percentage of sales will decline closer to our target of 10% as sales increased over the balance of the fiscal year. Now looking at interest expense for the quarter, it was $1.3 million compared to $1.9 million last year, and that's primarily as a result of the retirement of our remaining convertible notes during fiscal 2016. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.29 compared to $0.21 in the prior year, and that's a 38% increase in EPS, as David had mentioned. Now taking a look at cash for a moment, we used $0.5 million of cash from operations for the quarter. In the prior year first quarter, we used $64.4 million. Our capital expenditures in the quarter were $9.4 million and depreciation and amortization was $14.9 million. During the period, during the quarter, we paid dividends of $2.6 million and we also repurchased approximately 619,000 shares of our stock in the open market for a price of $14.8 million. And that leaves us, as of August 31, with $67.9 million available under our Board-authorized share repurchase program. Our net debt decreased $7.1 million and we ended with $143.7 million of net debt. And our net debt-to-capital ratio is low at 14%. Our composites manufacturing business has continued to perform well, and as a result, we decided to retain it within our Expeditionary Services segment. And we've reclassified this into continuing operations for all the periods presented. So finally - so at this point, we are sticking to our guidance of $1.30 to $1.40. And we feel good about the quarter that just ended and we feel good about our outlook, but we're going to stick to our guidance at this point. So thanks for your interest. And I'll turn the call back over to David.
David Storch:
Thank you, Tim. So as you can see, first quarter 2017 was a nice improvement. We saw a nice improvement over the prior year. Our Aviation Services segment continued to exhibit strong growth, and our Expeditionary Services segment improved from recent performance levels. Once again, we ended the quarter in excellent financial position, giving us not just stability and flexibility, but also capacity to go ahead and look to take advantage of market opportunities as they present themselves. We will continue to make investments in our industry-leading operations as we move into fiscal year 2017, and I'm excited about our future prospects. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open up the lines for any questions you may have.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] And our first question or comment comes from the line of Larry Solow. Your line is now open.
Larry Solow:
Great thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just maybe just on the Aviation Services side, it looks like supply chain is doing really well, big growth there, obviously adding more contracts and whatnot. Aftermarket, anything changing there? Anything in your - in the trading business? And then perhaps a better look just on the MRO side and what's going on there, would be great.
David Storch:
Well, MRO had, as I think we signaled in the past, MRO's results this quarter are the softest historically for the year. And they didn't disappoint in that regard this year. It was soft again. To give you a sense of positions we had, on average, let's call it, in the middle of August, we had about 33 positions. When I say positions, I mean, aircraft and the hangars for maintenance. And now, we're running at 44 or mid-40s, I should - 40, 40-ish right now, September, and then we go up to 44 in November. So it will start ramping again as the year progresses. The supply chain business, as you say, Larry, is strong. We're seeing many opportunities. John Holmes is not with us here today in Chicago because he's out visiting with customers trying to drum up some additional business and actually meeting with a customer in our New York facility today. So yes, we're expecting, we're hopeful that we can announce a contract after October 1 that we were working out for quite some time. That's a pretty good size. And I would say around the horn, the supply chain businesses are strong. Aviation, the MRO has gone through its typical, cyclical experience and strengthening. And we're feeling pretty good about where we are today.
Larry Solow:
Okay. So the MRO is more seasonality than anything else. And how about just Lake Charles? I know there's been some headwinds there. Can you maybe just give…?
David Storch:
Yes, we've been diminishing our footprint there. We're keeping it open for now for some light paint work type work. As we've discussed before, we - the State of Illinois has constructed a facility for us in Rockford that we're kind of pivoting towards. And hopefully, we'll be generating some revenue and income coming out of that facility in the not-too-distant future. We'll keep you up to speed on that.
Larry Solow:
Got it. And just switching gears real quick on the Expeditionary side, it's I realize just sort of the, rather small numbers, and if you go back 3 years ago, gross profit was leagues higher, but a pretty nice improvement from the sort of low single digits to $8 million this quarter. And you said that was mostly on the Mobility side. I thought, I figured airlift also improved a little bit from the ramp in the Falkland Islands and…
David Storch:
Yes. Yes, the airlift has improved a little bit...
Larry Solow:
And how about mobility? What's sort of your thoughts there?
David Storch:
Well, our thoughts are that we're seeing signs of life in both businesses. So we are seeing the inquiry level get stronger, and we're not overcommitting at this point. So, let's see what happens. I mean, as you know, the world environment is unsettled as ever and it's just a question of how much more action will - the U.S. will see outside in these different theaters, and that will be a good proxy for how our businesses do.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And then just on the INL contract, I don't know what you can or can't say. Thoughts on potential margin being at least accretive to your current margins or maybe just on timing, assuming the ramping starts up in the early calendar 2017, would that first 6 months be dilutive? Or would that - how would that ramp sort of play out on a high level, David.
David Storch:
Why don't we hold off from making comments on the contract, it's in the protest period. And I think we'll talk about it once it emerges out of protest.
Larry Solow:
That sounds great. Thanks David, appreciate it.
David Storch:
Yeah, thank you.
Operator:
Alright. And our next question or comment comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions guys, nice quarter.
David Storch:
Sure, thanks.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
On the SG&A, obviously, it's a little bit high in the quarter, 11% of revenue. In the press release, you guys talked about some new business development efforts that drove that. Just wondering if there's any more color you can give on those whether there's specific areas or programs you can discuss.
David Storch:
Yes, so we've expanded our program selling capability, and I think what you're seeing here in some of these announcements is a reflection of their efforts. And we have a team of folks who joined us last year, and they're a wonderful team. They complement our organization in a very positive way. And we're very hopeful that we'll continue to benefit from their efforts. Also, first quarter is always a little softer for us because of MRO sales. But we anticipate - our goal is always to be below 10% and our goal is to get down to that level before the fiscal year is out.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. Thanks David. On the composites business, obviously bringing that back in under Mobility. Can you just remind us, was said that under Mobility previously, or was that within the Aviation business?
David Storch:
Yes. No, no, no, before, we had a manufacturing group of businesses, and it was - that's where it was. And when we sold off the businesses and we kind of restructured the manufacturing, we basically just stopped and looked to exit both the composites business and the metals business. We ultimately wound down the metals business, but the composite business, which we were trying to sell, we weren't able to get prices that we're happy with, so we thought it was best, from the customers' perspective, our people - for our people, et cetera, to go ahead and try to revitalize the business, which - and we've had some success in that regard. So, the business, based on how we see the markets unfolding, the leadership team at Mobility is a very capable leadership team, as you know. And they were eager to take on some added responsibility and they now have this operation as part of their business.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Can you may be touch on what maybe specific end markets are seeing or are driving that revitalization that you mentioned? Are there specific markets you can point to where you're starting to see some traction there?
David Storch:
We've had success in the past and continue to have success serving some of the regional manufacturers. We've had some success on interiors for certain specialized aircraft. That business continues to be strong. So, I mean, we're looking at opportunities to support the Boeings of the world and the folks who support Boeing, as well some of the regional carriers that are out there as well. So, it's kind of like a niche-like business. We have some activity in the flat-panel world. And I don't know, Tim, is there anything else to add?
Tim Romenesko:
No, that's pretty good. We're supporting some of the helicopter manufacturers. But that piece of the business has been doing pretty well.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Is that - is it mostly commercial or mostly military or a good mix of the 2?
Tim Romenesko:
It's both, but it's - both, but it's mostly commercial.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. And then last one for me. I know last quarter you guys mentioned that the engineering services business had a pretty nice quarter. I don't think you specifically called it out this quarter, but maybe just some color on what you're seeing there. I know - I think that tends to be a bit of a leading indicator for kind of the broader overhaul market, so maybe just some color on the engineering business.
David Storch:
Yes, I think the engineering business has had a couple of wins. We had one out of Africa, actually. The business is doing okay. It's got some opportunities that they're looking at. But at this point in time, it's not a needle mover either way.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] And our next question or comment comes from the line of Stan Mann with Mann Family Investors. Your line is now open.
Stan Mann:
Congratulations, a really good quarter.
David Storch:
Thanks Stan.
Stan Mann:
David, I have a question on priority use of cash as you generate. Would you say your emphasis is on buyback or acquisition? Or can you give us any color on what you think you'd utilize for in a priority basis?
David Storch:
Yes. The first priority is to use our capital to grow our business, strengthen our franchise and improve the depth of product that we offer to our customers. So that would be our prime - that would be our first priority. Short of being able to increase the business in that fashion, we - and let me make that into a part A and Part B. Part A of that is external deal, let's say acquisitions. Part B is funding existing capability. In the quarter just ended for instance, we spent a fair amount of money funding inventory programs for our strategic customers. Then, next, I'd say, share repurchase would be next. And of course, the Board, every quarter, reviews our dividend, our dividend policy, and that's always discussed as well.
Stan Mann:
Can you comment on whether you are close to or see viable deals, accretive deals, in what you're looking at now?
David Storch:
We're seeing deals that are interesting. We're not seeing anything that is compelling necessarily, but we are seeing stuff out there. There's a fair amount of stuff that we're looking at. As you know, we're being very selective and disciplined, but I would say the deal flow on the acquisition side is moderate, light to moderate in a general sense.
Stan Mann:
Okay. Last question is you've got - you've almost won the State Department contract for their fleet. So, if you look - let's assume we get that, do you see that as being accretive from a get-go? Or maybe you can't comment because of the challenge?
David Storch:
Yes, Stan, so first of all, we were awarded the contract.
Stan Mann:
Yes.
David Storch:
So we have a contract. The contract is under a protest - under the protest. We're issued a stay order by the customer or a stop order. So, we are not working. We are no longer working on that contract, but we do have a contract. In terms of the profitability or impact on company's results, we prefer not to discuss that at this stage.
Stan Mann:
Okay. But it is a good contract for the company?
David Storch:
Well, I prefer not to discuss it. I think it's a contract that - it's a program that we have a high level of confidence that - or well we know that we can deliver in a way that's superior to anything that the customer's accustomed to. And that's all I would say.
Stan Mann:
Okay. But in quantity, in dollar volume, you can't comment, potential dollar volume contribution?
David Storch:
I think the State Department put up a release, which indicated the potential value up to $10 billion.
Stan Mann:
That’s pretty good. Okay, thank you very much. Good job.
David Storch:
Okay, thank you.
Operator:
And I'm showing no further questions or comments at this time.
David Storch:
Okay. Well, once again, thank you for your participation. And I wish everybody a very good day. Take care.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the AAR's Fiscal 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Sharp, Chief Financial Officer; Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Expeditionary Services; and John Holmes, Chief Operating Officer of Aviation Services. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news releases and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch. Sir, please go ahead.
David Storch:
Thank you, ma’am, and good afternoon, and thanks to those who are joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results. Overall, we had a good quarter and our business has performed in line with our expectations. Today, I will share some highlights on the results and then turn the call over to Mike who will provide some detail on the financials, and then we will open up to questions. First off on our Aviation Services segment, we saw sales increase of 11.2% or 40.2 million, so really good organic growth. Our distribution programs sub businesses delivered strong results. Growth was primarily driven by the ramp up of a few distribution lines as well as new government contracts including C-130 over in Afghanistan and C-40A support contracts. During the quarter, we announced several key wins that will expand our global presence going forward. We signed an agreement with UTC Aerospace Systems to distribute products to an Asian defense customer. That’s a multiyear contract. We’ve already made the investments. The revenues, though, won’t start until later in the fiscal year. We won a contract with fastjet, a leading low cost carrier in Africa to provide power-by-the-hour component inventory management and repair services for their fleet of A319 aircraft. We also won a similar contract with Volotea, a Spanish low cost carrier also operating the A319 series aircraft. Finally, subsequent to quarter end, we announced that we were awarded a multiyear contract or a series of multiyear contracts to provide rotable component and wheel, tire and brake services for CommutAir’s ERJ 145 fleet that we’ll be operating in support of United Airlines. This tip-to-tail support program simplifies the type of turnkey solutions we’re able to offer with our breadth of expertise and scale. Our trading businesses performed on a sequential basis and also when we compare it to the prior year. And our MRO operations experienced organic double-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter. This was principally driven by strong capacity utilization across our airplane and maintenance network where we sold over 1.4 million man hours in the quarter. We also saw higher volumes on our landing gear repair, component repair and engineering service business lines. Turning over to Expeditionary Services, we had a slight increase in sales, mostly driven by the launch of our Falkland Islands search and rescue program, which we kicked off in April. Our team did a great job setting up this operating and our execution has been flawless thus far. During the quarter we also secured a $21.7 million new contract win as well as an extension of an existing contract, each one covering operations in Afghanistan. But despite these positive developments, our airlift business continues to be challenged and we’re looking for ways to get better results from that business. Thank you for your attention. I’ll turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Sharp:
Thanks, David. I will now discuss our fourth quarter financial performance in a bit more detail and start by saying that sales for the quarter were 458.2 million, up a strong 10.2% over the prior year. As David mentioned, Aviation Services sales increased 40.2 million or 11.2% year-over-year while Expeditionary Services segment sales reported a slight increase in sales. The gross profit margin in Aviation Services was 15.8%. As discussed in the past, margins in this segment will fluctuate based on mix of product and services sold and that is what we saw this period. In the Expeditionary Services segment, the gross profit margin was slightly positive at 1.9% and continues to reflect the softness in the markets we serve in this segment. SG&A expenses as a percent of sales were 10.1% and improved from 12.3% last year and 10.6% of sales in our third quarter. Again, overall, we feel good about our cost structure and the opportunity for improvement in this ratio will largely come from continuing to increase sales. Net interest expense was 1.1 million in the period compared to 7 million last year and reflects the significant decline in average outstanding borrowings compared with this time last year. Our effective income tax rate for the period was 34%. Turning to cash, we generated a strong $46 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter. CapEx for the quarter was 14.2 million and depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of stock-based compensation, was 13.5 million. During the period we paid $2.6 million of dividends and repurchased approximately 61,000 shares in the open market for 1.4 million. As of May 31, a little under $83 million remains available under the Board authorized share repurchase plan. As a result of the strong cash flow from operations, net debt decreased $26 million from February 29 to end the year at $119 million. Our net debt to capital ratio remains a low 12%. During the fourth quarter, we retired the remaining 25.7 million of our convertible notes. The annual book interest savings associated with this retirement was approximately 1.4 million and we saw a full quarter's worth of savings in Q4. Thanks, and I’ll now turn the call back over to David.
David Storch:
Thanks, Mike. Overall, as I indicated earlier, fiscal year 2016 was a solid year for the company with strong organic sales growth in Aviation Services. We ended the year with an excellent financial position that gives us stability, flexibility and capacity to capitalize on market opportunities. We will continue to make investments in our industry-leading operations as we move into fiscal year '17, and I am excited about our future prospects. On that note, let me conclude my comments with our guidance for fiscal year '17. As stated in our earnings release, we currently expect sales in the range of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion. We anticipate further growth in our Aviation Services segment and slight improvement in Expeditionary Services. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2017 is expected to be in a range of $1.30 to $1.40, which at the midpoint represents an increase of 16.4% compared for the full year of fiscal year 2016. As you consider this guidance, note that we expect a feasibly low first quarter with results improving throughout the year. At the point, let me turn the call back to the operator for any questions you may have.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Hi. Good afternoon, guys.
David Storch:
Hi, Kevin.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Looking at corporate expense and I guess particularly the SG&A line, I know when you divested Telair, you had talked about seeing a 20% reduction in corporate expense as a target. Just wondering, maybe Mike, if you can talk a little bit about kind of where you are against that target, and is there still room to bring corporate down and maybe how you’re thinking about SG&A for next year?
Michael Sharp:
So we communicated that target reduction, Kevin, last year and that was all largely realized sometime in the first quarter of this fiscal year. I think largely we’ve completed all those activities. There is always perhaps some room. But as I indicated, Kevin, we’re pretty comfortable with the cost structure not just at corporate but across the company not that we don’t analyze and continue to focus on it. But that ratio that we tend to talk about as a percent of sales we think it’s mostly going to improve as we go forward from increasing sales.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. And then maybe on the – sticking to the margin theme and Expeditionary as we look at next year, margins have bounced around a little bit there over the past couple of years. We’ve seen a couple of quarters that were negative. How are we looking at Expeditionary margins for next year? Are you guys viewing that as being profitable through the whole year?
David Storch:
Yes, let me ask Tim to answer that question, Kevin.
Timothy Romenesko:
Hi, Kevin. So we’re looking for improved margins off of fiscal 2016 base. You probably saw today that we were awarded a couple of new contract positions in Afghanistan for S-61 helicopters. We expect those to start contributing to our results late in this quarter and really have a full effect in the second quarter. So between that, the five-year program and some of the other things that we’re working on and we are expecting improved margins from fiscal '16 levels.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. And Tim, while I have you, in terms of active positions right now I think based on what you said last quarter, if you hadn’t lost any, you should be at 22. Can you talk a little bit about where we are in airlift right now?
Timothy Romenesko:
Yes, so we’re at 21 today. We picked up the two additional in Afghanistan and we ended the third quarter at 19.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay, perfect. And then last one from me and I’ll jump back in queue. Can you talk about what you’ve seen in the trading business over the past few months? I know it was getting a little bit tougher in terms of competition. Supply was tightening. Have you seen any shift in either direction in that business? And I know it’s a pretty high margin business for you guys historically. Is that creating any kind of margin headwinds on the Aviation Services side?
David Storch:
So Kevin, this is David once again. I don’t believe that the pressures have been around competition as much as the pressures have been around overall market demand. So this quarter was a pretty decent quarter for that business, improvement sequentially and improvement year-on-year; correct and that the levels are not where we may have been historically and correct that we’ve been fairly profitable in this business. So we remain cautiously optimistic that as we move along into the new fiscal year, these businesses will perform well and have a positive impact on year-over-year margin results.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions].
David Storch:
There may be a problem with people getting questions in, because I know there were a couple of people who expressed interest in getting questions but we don’t see their names on your list.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions]. I have a follow up from Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
I’ll jump back in since mine’s working. On that KC-10 contract I know you guys have lost out as a prime bidder. Is there any chance going forward that you could get pulled back in as a sub to L-3 on that or are you aware that they’re planning on going that alone?
David Storch:
I think we’re best off probably not commenting on that. We don’t see that necessarily as a possibility but probably best not to comment.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. And then on the INL contract that you guys are bidding on, the Department of State put out an additional one year extension for the incumbent. Can you just talk a little bit about – obviously it’s frustrating for you guys I’m sure. Can you talk a little bit about what that extension does or doesn’t do in terms of allowing the Department of State to announce a winner for the full competition? Does that prevent them from doing that until that extension’s up or could they do that at any point in the interim?
David Storch:
We’re not aware of any impact on their decision-making process. We’re aware of the extension. But again I think probably best off not to comment.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. Thanks, David.
David Storch:
Yes.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’m sorry, Mr. Greg Dean with Worden Capital, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Gregory Dean:
How’s it going guys?
David Storch:
Good.
Gregory Dean:
Good. This might be a foolish question but I just decided to ask. With current cabinet in office, are there any expectations or concerns with change in cabinet potentially going democrat to republican in the next handful of months?
David Storch:
No difference on our business.
Gregory Dean:
Okay. Thank you.
David Storch:
We want the best people to serve.
Gregory Dean:
Got you. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Lewis with High Road Value [ph]. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst:
Hi. Thanks. Just one and maybe this came up on the last conference call but can you give us any kind of update as far as winding down the manufacturing operations that you discontinued a year or so ago? Are they still on board or are we still in a disposition there?
David Storch:
Obviously, we’ve sold the cargo business. That was a very successful transaction. We have successfully wound down the metals business and the composites business is still in our discontinued portfolio.
Unidentified Analyst:
Okay, that’s it. Thanks.
David Storch:
Thanks, Tom.
Operator:
Thank you. I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the conference back over to management. I’m sorry, I am now seeing one other question from the line of Bill Jacobs with Jacobs Investment. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Bill Jacobs:
Thanks. I’m just looking at – it looks like the implied margins for fiscal '17 are something like 4.5% as you look at it on an EBIT basis and I think the market was looking for something closer to 6%. What do you see long term where you can get margins overall? Are we – I guess a lot of it depends on what happens with Expeditionary, but I guess what the market’s disappointed about is that we are expecting the margin improvement and don’t seem to be getting much.
David Storch:
We’re getting margin improvement in our core Aviation Service businesses and we’ve expressed certain disappointments around airlift. We also are waiting on certain contracts and we’d be disappointed if our margins don’t get closer to the area you indicated.
Bill Jacobs:
So you think on a longer-term basis – maybe not in longer term, more intermediate term looking out two or three years, we can get sort of a 6%, 7% EBIT margins?
David Storch:
I think better than that.
Bill Jacobs:
Better than that?
David Storch:
Yes.
Bill Jacobs:
Okay. And then on Expeditionary, how long do you give it? At what point do you say, this is what the new world looks like and the money that we made in Afghanistan for those years has gone and it’s never going to be the business that it was. That was the aberration, not the current period and how long do you give it before you have to make a decision about whether this business fits – and the Aviation Services business is doing so well, how long do you give the other side of the shop?
David Storch:
First off, think of it as two different businesses. One business more tied to say recent activities in Afghanistan, one business that’s tied to true preparation, troop movements, et cetera, all over the world for the United States government. So the lineation would be – the distinction would be between our mobility business and our airlift business. In terms of – and if you look, the mobility business has been part of AAR since 1981 and has had in the past times of good performance and weaker performance based on the particular cycle surrounding those types of product and services. If you look at the airlift business, it’s a recent business to the company. To your point, it did very well in the Afghanistan build up. We’re looking closely at that business for ways to extract value and we will do the best we can. And if we get to the point where we can no longer extract the right value, we will take other actions.
Bill Jacobs:
Okay. Is a sale possible or do you think – I know that’s not what you’re looking at right now but if you think about that business and you say, okay, this isn’t working. Is there a logical buyer for these assets?
David Storch:
I don’t think that I’d look at it necessarily that way as much as – so we have some very meaningful contracts today. I think you heard earlier in the call we have 21 aircraft that we’re operating. Part of the challenge is the aircraft we have that are not operating. Some of the aircraft we do have up for sale and we do have interested parties in buying those assets. So it may very well be that the asset base gets compressed and also we take advantage of our knowledge, if you will, in serving helicopters to expand our services beyond just operating these aircraft.
Bill Jacobs:
All right, thank you.
David Storch:
Okay, thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. I’m showing no further questions at this time.
David Storch:
Okay. Thank you very much for your participation today.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the AAR's Fiscal 2016 Third Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Sharp, Chief Financial Officer; Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Expeditionary Services; and John Holmes, Chief Operating Officer of Aviation Services. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch:
Thank you. Thank you very much and good afternoon to all and thank you for joining us today to discuss our fiscal year third quarter results. Overall, the businesses delivered good results in what is historically our shortest quarter due to the holidays we have in December and, of course, February, although this year we picked up one day so a shorter month than other months. I'll share some highlights on our business performance and I'll turn it over to Mike to provide more details on the financials. Our Aviation Service business, we saw sales increase all organically of 9.7% and $30.8 million compared to the prior year. Distribution programs continued to deliver strong results driven by the ramp of recent contracts. We had a few key wins as well. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we were awarded a five-year, $105 million, firm fixed price contract by NAVAIR, for the procurement of contractor logistics support including commercial depot support and site support to the C-40A aircraft. We expect that work to commence approximately in 60 days and we're very excited about this winning this contract. The C-40A is a 737 derivative. It's an aircraft we have lots of experience with and, as I indicated, we're pretty excited to have won this contract. We are pleased and honored that our government customers routinely turn to AAR for comprehensive solutions that rely our broad capability set, deep expertise, and scale. We believe we bring valuable commercial off the shelf programs to the government customer. During the quarter we signed a power-by-the-hour contract with IBEX Airlines of Japan to support its fleet of CRJs. This win expands our presence in Asia and leverages the CRJ experience we currently have in North America supporting Mesa and Jazz. And on top of these wins, the pipeline for new business opportunities is strong and hopefully, in Q4, we'll be able to complete some of the transactions that are currently being negotiated. Our MRO operations experienced double-digit growth, capacity utilization. Our hangar network continues to be strong. We also saw higher volumes in our landing gear repair, component repair and engineering business lines. Moving over to Expeditionary Services, we saw sales decline of 8.1 million from the prior-year quarter. Mobility sales were down. Demand continues to be challenged there. But, as you know, we continue to be an industry leader with strong product offering and, if you look back in time, you'll note that from time to time that business does experience soft periods and then followed typically by periods of great strength. We remain optimistic with what the future holds for that business, even though today we're in a soft period. We recently announced a five-year, $49 million contract with the U.S. Army for the next generation automatic test shelters, an extension of contracts we've had in the past and we're very excited to have won that contract. Airlift revenue was up year-over-year. As we've talked about in the past, we commence operations on the Falkland contract. That begins April 1. We're operating two brand new AW189 helicopters. We've been spending the last few months in training, in preparation. There’s been a cost, if you will, that has been associated with those contracts against - costs associated with that contract running against our numbers in Qs 2 and 3 and, in Q4, that program turned positive. The aircraft are on site and all the necessary training and approvals are on schedule, so we're very excited. This will be our first search and rescue contract that we've had and we're pretty pleased with that as well. In addition, we formally launched our Rotorcraft Services business, which offers a suite of aftermarket sport services from across AAR and is rooted in our experience as an operator of the helicopters in our airlift operation. There's pressure, there's pricing pressure coming out of the DOD on our airlift business. We expect that to continue as demand has compressed, but once again, we think in time the demand for that product, that service will improve and increase as well. So overall, when you look at our operations, you look at our businesses, we feel very good about where we stand today. We feel good about the results that we experienced in Q3 and we come into Q4 with a fair amount of momentum. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Sharp:
Thanks, David. I will discuss our third quarter financial performance in more detail and start by saying that sales for the quarter were $402.8 million, up 6% over prior year. As David mentioned, Aviation Services sales increased $30.8 million or 9.7% higher over the prior year, while our Expeditionary Services segment reported a 13.1% decline in sales. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.31 and included a $1.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share reduction in income taxes recorded in the third quarter, primarily associated with truing up certain deferred taxes. The gross profit margin in Aviation Services was 16.8% this quarter compared with 15.9% last year. The increase in the gross profit margin was driven by improvement in certain of our supply chain programs, as well as within our MRO network, which benefited from higher sales. In the Expeditionary Services segment, the gross profit margin was slightly negative and reflects the decline in top line in the segment. SG&A expenses in the period were 10.6% of sales compared to 11% last year. As I mentioned in our call back in December, overall, we feel good about our cost structure and the opportunity for improvement in this ratio will largely come from increasing sales. Net interest expense was $1.6 million in the period compared with 6.4 million last year and reflects the significant decline in outstanding borrowings. Our effective tax rate for the period was 24.1% and, again, was lower due to the $1.6 million benefit. Going forward, we expect our effective income tax rate to approximate 35% to 36%. Turning to cash, we generated $2 million of cash from operations this quarter, which reflects investments of nearly $15 million of inventory to support our supply chain activities. CapEx for the quarter was $43.6 million. This amount is unusually high and includes the purchase of one AW189 rotary wing aircraft that was also sold and leased back in the period. This particular helicopter will support the Falkland Islands contract. We also had other one-time investments in the quarter. Again, this CapEx was unusually high and we expect CapEx will return to a more normal level in Q4 in the $7 million to $10 million range. Depreciation and amortization including amortization of stock-based compensation was $14.3 million. During the period, we paid $2.6 million of dividends and repurchased approximately 312,000 shares in the open market for $7.3 million. As of February 29, $84.1 million remains under the board authorized plan. As a result of the higher than normal CapEx, other investments in the business, and share buybacks, our net debt increased $145.3 million at the end of the period. However, our net debt to capital ratio remains a very low 14%. Subsequent to the quarter end, we retired the remaining $25.7 million of our convertible notes. The annual book interest savings associated with the retirement is approximately $1.4 million and we will see one quarter's worth of this savings in the fourth quarter. Thanks for your attention and I will now turn the call back over to David.
David Storch:
Hey, thanks, Mike, and thank you, everyone for joining today's call. In summary, it was a good quarter for the company. Aviation Services maintained very strong organic growth. We feel really good about that. We also feel good about our balance sheet position, and continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy capital to our shareholders' benefit. With that, I would like to turn the call back to the operator for any questions you may have.
Operator:
Thank you, sir. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Larry Solow:
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. David, in Aviation Services, another quality quarter about 10% growth on consecutive quarters. It seems to be driven by a good mixture across your businesses. Anything, trends during the quarter, you sound pretty optimistic. I mean, I know you had, at one point, thought this could be a - can maintain a sustainable high single-digit or even low double-digit top line growth. How do you feel about the business in general, and then specifically in the parts business, any commentary on that would be great. Thanks.
David Storch:
So, Larry, I feel good about the business. I feel we're in a good position. The demand seems to be pretty robust. I feel good about our positioning. We're doing good work out of our shop so the heavy maintenance business has been relatively strong. The supply businesses in total have been strong. We had the trading business was a little soft in the quarter, but better than the quarter before. And we're entering the fourth quarter with good momentum across all the businesses. So we feel good about the prospects for our Aviation Services businesses.
Larry Solow:
And this may be hard to measure or quantify, but maybe anecdotally with oil, although it's come back up a little bit, still I think the going belief is it'll remain well below it for the next at least near future, are you seeing some of these older planes stay on longer and with that, I guess, you would be a net beneficiary of that?
David Storch:
I can't say that we're seeing anything unusual in that regard. So I believe that there is a mixture as new aircraft are coming into the system. I believe a percentage of those aircraft are for growth and a percentage are to replace some of the older aircraft. But at the end of the day, our business benefits from just having more aircraft in the system. So if you look at the Navy aircraft we'll be supporting, those are 737-700s, relatively modern aircraft, and if you look at the mix of most of our customers today, you'll see that there's a good blend of newer aircraft and older aircraft. So I think as we move forward, I'm not sure if the price of fuel is playing a huge factor in this equation other than the airlines continue to do very well in this environment, and maintaining their schedules is important to them. So paying for the spare parts and the maintenance to be performed on a timely basis, I believe, is working in our favor. So there have been years past where airlines have deferred maintenance or they deferred inventory spend. I can't say that we're seeing that today.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And on the Expeditionary Services, mobility has that taken another it looks like another leg down or is that fairly some further drop from year-over-year?
David Storch:
Yeah. The mobility business has continued to surprise us to the negative. That being said, we did have a nice win on this one contract in the quarter. And I believe that business will be tough here, continue to be tough for the near term. At some point, the supplies are going to start diminishing the level of safety spares that the government maintains. And at that point, I would expect to see a pick-up in that business. So if you look at that business from a 30-year horizon standpoint, going back, you will have noted these kinds of times where there was a downward pressure. So this will be similar to what we experienced in 1998, 1999, 2000, but again, we feel good about our leadership position in this field. We know that the product is necessary. It's just not being ordered today but it will be ordered and we'll be in a good position to deal with it. We're taking good actions around the cost side, so we're improving our competitiveness on a going-forward basis. And yeah, I think we're taking the right actions.
Larry Solow:
Great. Just lastly, you guys had planned an Analyst's Day for April. Is that still in the works?
David Storch:
Yeah, no, the April date, as it turned out, we had conflict in a few different things. I think now we're going back to October which is the timeframe we've historically held our Analyst's Days. We tried to see if we could do it in July, but we ran into conflicts there with June's quarter earnings results. I think that was the same problem in April, too, as I think about it. So the October period is, I think - we'll run into some September quarter pressure but we're going to hold it a little earlier in October. So that's what we're shooting for.
Larry Solow:
Got you. Great, thanks.
David Storch:
Yeah.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn:
Hi there.
David Storch:
Hi, Rob.
Michael Sharp:
Hey, Rob.
Robert Spingarn:
So just sticking with Expeditionary. David, how do we think about - well, first maybe talk about the number of aircraft employed and what you expectations are, but then also some of the disappointment. It sounds like it's gotten a little incrementally worse than you would have expected and there's some pricing pressure. So how do we think about the number of aircraft going forward based on what you can see and then on the potential margins in this business, if this pricing pressure's going to stick around?
David Storch:
So let me turn it over to Tim to address the number of aircraft and an overall snapshot as to how we see things today.
Timothy Romenesko:
Yeah, so Rob, we are - we ended the quarter with the same 19 that we had on the first day of the quarter. Then we'll add three contract positions with the Falkland Islands contract. Its four aircraft but its three contract positions. The 189s are two aircraft to make one because of the location. We'll have to see. We've got contract positions that are up, that have been rebid and we'll see if we're able to retain them. The pricing pressure is extremely difficult, and we're really not inclined to tie up our assets for long periods of time at this kind of pricing level. So we're being disciplined on our pricing and kind of taking a longer view. So we'll see. At the same time, we're also looking for the non-DoD kind of battlefield support, more search and rescue opportunities like the Falkland Islands to diversify our business.
Robert Spingarn:
Is the pricing pressure demand driven or supply driven? Or is it both?
Timothy Romenesko:
Well, there's excess capacity, right? There are players - if you know the helicopter market, you know that there's not very much good going on, right? The oil and gas aircraft are significantly under-utilized. The DoD aircraft are significantly under-utilized. Some of the firefighting are under-utilized. So there is plenty of assets out there. So, I guess it’s fewer requirements from our core customer combined with a glut of equipment available.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. So with that in mind, David, we've talked in the past. We've framed this business as being potentially an equivalent contributor to the other business. You know, when we do the math, if we back out the tax help, I think you earned about $0.26 in the quarter and maybe only $0.01 of that was dilution from expeditionary's loss, small loss. But to get up to where you've been in the past, for Expeditionary to contribute a like or a similar quantity of earnings, in cents per share, it sounds like a huge amount has to happen.
David Storch:
Well, there's one contract in particular that happens will get us very close to that. So, I think we're defining the business in a broader sense, so we have a large contract that's been - we haven't talked about necessarily but it's been talked about that we're competing on that, if that were to come our way, that would go a long way to achieving what you just mentioned.
Robert Spingarn:
Is that contract simply binary? You win it or you lose it or could you share it?
David Storch:
Yes. No. Win or lose. It's binary.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. All right, thank you very much.
David Storch:
Yeah.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kevin Ciabattoni of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions.
David Storch:
Sure, Kevin.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Congratulations on that C-40A contract. That's a nice win for you guys. I'm wondering if you can give us any color around the revenue cadence for the contract. It looks like the initial order was I think $2 million or $3 million, so obviously pretty small relative to the overall size of the contract, so, just kind of curious how you see that playing out over the next four to five years.
David Storch:
Yeah, we believe the revenues will be more or less equal throughout the period. Now there will be other aspects which will contribute based on over and above, and things of that nature. But in essence, think of it as evenly distributed over the five-year period.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. That's helpful. Any update, David, on the INL contract in terms of timing? I know last quarter you thought January, February, it seems like they're dragging their feet with that a little bit. I know there was a letter put out earlier this month, kind of calling on them to award that by the end of June/July timeframe. How are you guys seeing that today?
David Storch:
Yeah, Kevin, it's out of our control. So it's in the hands of the government and we have reason to believe that they're inclined to make a decision in the next 30 to 45 days.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Have you gotten any insight into what's taking them so long to award that?
David Storch:
No.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. And then last one from me, on the Rotorcraft Services business, can you talk a little bit about maybe the markets you're primarily going after there and kind of what you see there in terms of a demand pipeline?
David Storch:
Yeah. So we're basically saying, for the last 60 years, we've been heavily involved in the fixed wing business, supporting fixed wing operators. We really entered the helicopter market with the acquisition of the airlift business back in 2010. We've been pretty busy flying airplanes. We always thought all along that we would - part of our strategy was to move into support for these asset types, and now we have the time, if you will, and resources to go ahead and do so. So we'll be approaching a broad-based market. We'll be looking to be in the supply and the repair ends of this market. And we'll pick our spots, we'll shoot for higher margin opportunities and hopefully you'll start seeing some results coming out of this in the near term.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
As a follow on to that, given the state of the rotorcraft market right now, I mean, you touched on it earlier, I guess I'd look and say, why now? What do you see is the advantage to getting into that market now just given the road bumps they're seeing there?
David Storch:
Yeah, I actually think there's so much dislocation in that market right now that it's an opportunity for somebody to come in with a clean balance sheet and a clean set - a new set of eyes to look at that market opportunistically, and that's how we're approaching it.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. Thanks.
David Storch:
Yeah.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from [ph] Stan Mann of Mann Family Investors. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst:
Good afternoon. Good overall job. I have three questions, David.
David Storch:
Okay.
Unidentified Analyst:
One is, are there opportunities near-term for adding onto our Aviation Services and MRO business realistically?
David Storch:
Adding on?
Unidentified Analyst:
Yeah.
David Storch:
So, think of the growth in two perspectives. If you look at the growth that you've seen here the last year or so, it's all been organically generated. And we have a very healthy pipeline, [ph] Stan, of opportunities. You'll see in the quarter we've made some investments in inventory to support some different activities that we have going on in that regard. So we're still a relatively small player in a very big pond. So I think there's a fair amount - we have an ambitious leadership team. They're covering a lot of bases today and they see lots of markets that are still available for us to participate in. So I think look for organic growth in that give-or-take 10% range. And you'll note that there's very few people in this industry growing at that rate organically. And matter of fact, you'd have a hard time pointing out any, at least, that are in the public domain that are growing at that rate organically. So we feel good about the organic growth prospects and the balance sheet is strong. I've indicated in the release today that we will look for acquisitions that make sense, and in that particular market, we're looking at a few different things. So I think our focus is on organic growth because it's fairly attractive, and secondly is look for acquisitions either bolt-on in nature or larger-scale in nature. And we have our eyes open for both.
Unidentified Analyst:
Do you see anything near-term, specifically in bolt-on, in the area that we are where we're strong and growing? I have a reason for the logic that I'm trying to...
David Storch:
I'd like to hear your reason before I respond.
Unidentified Analyst:
Well my rationale is I'm wondering, don't fall off your chair, if it isn't time to possibly sell off or move out of this Expeditionary primarily government market, like the Telair spinoff, but create a core that grows consistently and doesn't depend on government bids. It would be seem to me that we could increase our company valuation dramatically by making a step out of an erratic business or a non-predictable. That' just...
David Storch:
Yeah. So, [ph] Stan, if we were having this conversation five years ago, you would have said why don't you sell off your commercial business because you're doing so well in the defense market that why would you go ahead and minimize the progress you're making in that market by being in the commercial market? So I think if you look back in time and you've been a shareholder for a period of time, you'll note that we've had, by having this balance, we've been able to perform quite well through good times and bad times. Now we're at an extreme point in time in that the Expeditionary businesses are at their low point, their absolute low point in the cycle. And our view is that this wouldn't be a good time to do what you just indicated because this isn't - we wouldn't be maximizing value. So we have long memories and even short memories, and these businesses are at leadership positions in their markets. It doesn't mean that we're married to these forever. Clearly, we're not. But at the same token, I think that the strategy of maintaining this two-prong capability is the right strategy at this moment. It doesn't mean that we're not going to explore different possibilities. And we have, as you know, we have a very dynamic board group. And once a year, we do in-depth strategic reviews at every quarterly board meeting. We have discussion about the company's strategy. So we'll continue to look at what's best for our shareholders.
Unidentified Analyst:
Okay. So last part is it seems to me we have a large potential stock buyback. I feel our stock is a bargain. I mean, so we have $80 million-something open, I believe, to buy in the buyback.
David Storch:
That's correct, $81 million.
Unidentified Analyst:
So at this point do you think that that could be a best investment option for us that we don't have M&A closed in, et cetera?
David Storch:
Well, we invested $35 million or $40 million this quarter in ways that we think are going to grow the business. We also invested $7 million or so in share repurchases. I mean, my preference is to grow the business and to use our capital base to grow the business. But from time-to-time, when we deem it appropriate, we will look to opportunistically purchase the shares. But we're not looking at purchasing the shares as a strategy to growth. We're looking at the purchasing of shares as a way to balance out our performance and the use of our capital. Right now, we're seeing some very interesting growth opportunities for the company, and we have in the period of time that we've been a net investor in the businesses and the way I'm seeing things today, I see us continuing to invest in the business as a priority to buying in the shares. It doesn't mean we're not going to buy any shares. It's just that my preference right now is to support the growth of the company and we're seeing some pretty attractive opportunities in this regard.
Unidentified Analyst:
Well, I do trust your judgment. I just suggest that maybe we sometimes have too much patience.
David Storch:
Got it.
Unidentified Analyst:
But I'm a long-time holder...
David Storch:
Got it.
Unidentified Analyst:
And I see good things in areas that are not being recognized. That's the only reason for my comment.
David Storch:
Got it.
Unidentified Analyst:
But good job, good quarter and thank you.
David Storch:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. As we have no further questions in queue, I'd like to turn the call over to David Storch for any closing remarks.
David Storch:
Thank you very much for participating today and I wish everybody a good week. And look forward to chatting in 90 days from today. Be well. Bye-bye.
Operator:
Thank you, sir. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. That does conclude your program. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day."

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Call. We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Sharp, Chief Financial Officer; Tim Romenesko, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Expeditionary Services; and John Holmes, Chief Operating Officer of Aviation Services. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined by Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and risk factor section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch:
Thank you, sir, and good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter of fiscal 2016 results. Overall, as you can see, it was a strong quarter and top line growth and cash flow generation and performance was consistent with our expectation. I plan to share some of our highlights on business performance and I'll turn it over to Mike Sharp who will provide more detail on the financials and then we will come back to the Q&A. First off, Aviation Services saw a growth in sales of $33.7 million on a comparative to prior year basis which was up 10.3% and just reiterating that's organic growth, no acquisitions in the period. Distribution programs delivered strong results again in both – supported both our commercial and government end markets as our innovative solutions and services are resonating with key customers. During the period, our C-130 support program for the US Air Force in Afghanistan began generating revenue and we launched a repair management program for the Royal Saudi Air Force as a subcontractor to Northrop Grumman. We're experiencing improved operational performance on our largest airline consumable and expandable program. Trading improved on a sequential basis, but was down year-over-year and across our one MRO network, we experienced double-digit growth driven largely by higher utilizations in our hangers. We continue air work in Lake Charles which reported a record top line this quarter and Duluth celebrated the completion of its 200th aircraft for Air Canada marking a new milestone in what has been a great customer relationship. Landing gear repair was up 16% of the period on higher volumes. And looking ahead to the second half the year, we expect continuous strength in supply chain as we ramp some of our distribution program contracts and continued strength in MRO based on robust order book and increasing bid activity. Expeditionary Services on the other hand saw a sales decline of $13.2 million from the prior year, largely due to lower demand and delayed decisions for program awards by our government customers. Airlift was down year-over-year, but performance was up slightly on a sequential basis. And during the quarter we were awarded extensions on our VERTREP program and we also started incurring costs associated with our MOD, British Ministry of Defense program support of the Falkland Search & Rescue contract. Mobility also was negatively impacted by lower demand. However, our integrated technologies sub-business inside mobility did announce some contract wins during the period with US Air Force and US Army. As we look ahead to the second half of the fiscal year for this segment, our customers, although they foresee needs for airlift services, solicitations continue to be delayed largely due to insufficient funding and political uncertainty. And due market headwinds, we do expect continuous softness in the third quarter for this segment and then some improvement come Q4 as the revenue for the MOD Search & Rescue contract kicks in. We continue to be market leaders in airlift mobility. We remain confident in our ability to win new awards when decisions are made and new RFPs hit the market. So with that, if I may, let me turn it over to Mike and he can provide a little bit more financial color.
Mike Sharp:
Thanks David, I trust that each of you have had an opportunity to review our earnings announcement. I want to discuss our second-quarter performance in a bit more detail and start by saying that sales for the quarter were $423.8 million, which is up on a consolidated basis, 5.1% over the prior year. As David mentioned, aviation services sales increased $33.7 million, up 10.3% year over year, while expeditionary services segment reported a 17% decline in sales. The gross profit margin in aviation services was 16.2% this quarter compared to 16.5% last year. A slight decline in the margin year to year at aviation services was principally caused by mix within our supply chain activity reflecting increased program and distribution sales and less trading revenue. In the expeditionary services segment, the gross profit margin declined to 2.6% of sales caused by the decline in revenues, mix of business within the segment and as David mentioned start-up costs associated with the Falkland Islands contract. SG&A expenses in the period were 10% of sales compared to 10.4% in our first quarter. As many of you know, this ratio has historically run between 9% and 10% for the company. We feel good about our cost structure and the real opportunity for additional improvement in this ratio is by increasing sales. Net interest expense was $1.5 million in the period compared to $6.5 million last year and reflects the significant decline in outstanding borrowings. Our effective tax rate for the period was 33.8% and includes a small favorable adjustment for our completed state tax audit. We expect our tax rate to approximate 35% in the back half of the year. We had strong cash generation in the quarter generating a little under $48 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures for the period were $15.7 million, inclusive of two payments on two AW189 rotary wing aircraft that was since sold and leased back. These are the two aircrafts we will be using on the British MOD contracts in the Falklands. Depreciation and amortization, including amortization of stock-based compensation was $14.3 million. Net debt declined $43.3 million from August 31, to end debt $107.5 million. During the period we bought back 9.7 million of our convertible notes. The remaining amount of the convertible notes is 25.7 million and will be retired March 1, 2016. The book expense interest rate on these converts is 7.4% and we expect additional annual interest savings of approximately $1.4 million once these notes are retired in March. During the period, we paid $2.6 million of dividends and repurchased 142,000 shares in the open market for $2.8 million. As of November 30, there is a little over $91 million available under the Board authorized share repurchase plan. Now thanks for your attention and I will turn the call now back over David.
David Storch:
Thanks Mike. So as you can see pretty good quarter, good double-digit organic growth in aviation services, good cash flow. Balance sheet is in wonderful position. We’re kind of looking for ways to invest the capitals wisely. We do have some deal flow but we are staying very similar discipline in our deployment of capital. So with that let me open up to any questions you might have.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] First question is from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Lee Jagoda:
Hi, this is actually Lee Jagoda for Larry, good afternoon. Can you quantify the sort of expenses from the Falkland contract in the quarter and what if any additional expenses you might expect prior to the contract generating revenue?
David Storch:
I mean we are not necessarily disclosing that this moment, but it’s not insignificant. It’s a little bit – it will be higher in Q3 than it was in Q2, but then we will start, obviously as we start getting revenues in Q4, it turns from being a drag to being a contributor.
Lee Jagoda:
Sure. And then looking at Aviation Services, given that it sounds like the trading and parts business was actually a negative to the growth, what, in your opinion, is driving the strong growth? And how do you look at the sustainability of that going into the back half of the year?
David Storch:
Well, I think we’ve made a series of – we have had series of contract wins. I believe our business model is appealing to a broad range of customers commercially, and our commercial markets and defense customers. And yes, I think our team is doing a nice job, good leadership coming out of John Holmes’ office and his team surrounding him is executing and doing a good job.
Lee Jagoda:
Okay. And one more from me and I'll hop back in queue. Are you guys seeing any of the benefits from lower oil prices and extending the useful lives of aircraft in the fleet?
David Storch:
I don’t really – I won’t have an answer for that, that would be quantitative in nature. My sense is that fleets are – that the airlines are adding capacity and more capacity is good for our business.
Lee Jagoda:
Fair enough. Thanks very much. I'll hop back in the queue.
Operator:
Thank you. Next question is from Kevin Ciabattoni of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice quarter. You mentioned the parts trading business down year-over-year but up sequentially. I mean, are you better positioned now, you think, in terms of your inventory? I know, I think last quarter it sounded like maybe there was some mismatch there. Maybe, David, if you could just give us an update.
David Storch:
I think our inventory is in good position. We were a little bit surprised Q1 in terms of the softness. I believe our inventory has probably ballooned a little bit Q1 and I think they are probably more in line with the results coming out of Q2. So we have a great position in this market, not just here in the United States, but worldwide and we had nice improvement, Q2 over Q1, notwithstanding the fact that on a year-over-year basis, we were down. So great team in place, and again, I believe that that market – our performance will be fine.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. Can you give us an update on what – where you are in terms of airlift positions to finish the quarter, and maybe also kind of what the bid pipeline's looking like there currently? I know it sounds like there are some delays in terms of awards, but just in terms of what you're seeing on RFPs, et cetera.
David Storch:
Let me turn it over to Tim Romenesko.
Tim Romenesko:
Yeah, so we ended the quarter with 22 positions, but then on December 1, three positions – three contract positions were completed. Those we expect to be put out for rebid here in the next few months and we got a chance at least to get those back. There are a few other larger RFPs that we think are going to be coming, we heard are going to be coming, but we haven’t seen them yet, and these are the RFPs that we have been talking for a few quarters here. So as David mentioned in this comments, they have been slow to hit the market and it’s impacted our results and our outlook.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
So, with those three positions rolling off ahead of the Falklands coming back – coming on in 4Q, I mean, is it likely that we'll see negative gross margins out of expeditionary in the third quarter?
Tim Romenesko:
We’re looking – the third quarter we're expecting to be lighter than the second quarter due to the three positions coming out as well as the increase in cost that David referred to related to the startup of the Falklands program, so yes.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. And last one, I’ll jump back in queue. Any update you can give on where things stand with the DynCorp legal matter and then also related to that, I guess where the recompete stands for that program? We've also heard that they’re considering splitting that contract up into multiple silos, does that impact your revenue opportunity there on the recompete?
David Storch:
Well, they already split a year ago from the traditional INL contract. So that's pretty well known -- that's generally well-known. In terms of our expectation for the current bid, let's say, we're not aware of any – there has been no indication of a desire to split that. So we think we have a good competitive solution set and we maintain, we’ve submitted our proposal and we’re waiting to hear.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Have you got any update on timing there as to when they expect to award that?
David Storch:
I think we’re led to believe somewhere in the January-February timeframe.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. And nothing on the legal matter that you can?
David Storch:
No. I mean I think so far, all decisions have been -- are public in nature and have been favorable towards us.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question is from Stan Mann of Mann Family Investments. Your line is open.
Stan Mann:
Yes. Good afternoon. I have three questions. One on cash utilization, David, you mentioned acquisitions, you mentioned buybacks, is there anything you can, any color that you can give us on your sense are acquisitions near, far, are they -- are you looking at accretive, a little color on cash utilization?
David Storch:
The only confidence I have is accretive. So anything that happens will be accretive. In terms of near or far, it will be relatively out of our control. We are actively engaged on a few situations, but it's hard to say whether decisions are imminent or not. So we will continue to look at all the different possibilities. Obviously, the balance sheet is in very strong position and with some of the uncertainty in the world, we view that as a pretty good position to be in.
Stan Mann:
Okay. And the buybacks, of course, you have $91 million, which could be a significant reduction in shares outstanding? There seem to be worse that are occurring or battles, including the Saudis and Yemen with Air Force and troops. And now I guess the Great Britain and US are sending operations teams to Helmand Province in Afghanistan. Will any of those events have a near term effect on our business?
David Storch:
I'm not sure. I can't say I have an answer to that. I think if pace picks up, so there is more action, then it will have a favorable impact on our business, but I can't comment because I just don't know if moving people into Helmand province or other things you referenced will have an impact on our -- meaningful impact on our business.
Stan Mann:
Okay. The reason I asked about the Saudis is you said that you had a Saudi air repair contract that you jointly administer?
David Storch:
Right. So yeah, I'm not aware of any direct impact. Our relationship with the UAE, they are also actively engaged in the Yemen market, should be favorable to, but I can't think of anything short term.
Stan Mann:
Are you seeing additional solicitations or interests?
David Storch:
We’re seeing lots of interest and we are seeing solicitations. I don't believe the necessary related to those items, Stan, I think they’re related to the needs in a general sense.
Stan Mann:
Okay. It’s positive though potentially?
David Storch:
I don't think how it can get any more negative.
Stan Mann:
Okay. Thanks. Good job, gentlemen.
David Storch:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time.
David Storch:
Okay. Well, thank you, ladies and gentlemen for participating and thank you for your confidence in our company. Appreciate. Take care. Bye-bye.
Operator:

Operator:
Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2015 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligations to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch:
Good morning and thank you for participating today. As you know, yesterday last evening we put out our fourth quarter and year-end release. What I'd like to do is just spend some time going through where we are at and where we are heading, and I'll then turn it over to John who will fill in some of the financial data. So as we indicated at last year's annual planning session, we felt that we'd be better served, our shareholders will be better served if we narrowed our focus and zeroed in on our industry-leading services business as an area for growth and opportunity. So, we set out during the year and determined that we would sell our large manufacturing businesses, and like I said focus on our industry leading service activity, and we really think about the activity in four phases. Phase 1, which we indicate was the sale of Telair Cargo Group which was completed at the end of March, and then the classification of our precision machining businesses as discontinued operations. Upon completing this, we do still maintain our mobility business, which as you know is an industry leading business currently still off the point at the cycle, but a business nevertheless that has served the company well over a long period of time and a very strong management team, very strong position, and unique business, and we feel at this point in time that we'd like to figure out still how to maximize that business and our investment in that business. Phase 2, we paid down our high yield bonds, and we returned a significant amount of money, capital I should say to shareholders. So, we paid down our $325 million of roughly 7% interest rated bonds. By paying that down, we will save about $23 million to $24 million a year in interest expense. And then, we also as you know, through the tender offer purchased back 4.2 million shares. We've purchased another 0.5 million shares in the open market. So we've returned about $152 [ph] million in cash to shareholders here through share repurchase and dividends. Phase 3, we've really been looking through the balance of our portfolio to identify and exit underperforming activities. So again, we could zero in on and focus on those areas where we feel we have the most potential and biggest opportunities. So you see that we sold off the remaining of our owned aircraft from our aircraft leasing portfolio which we really started disinvesting back in 2007, this is more or less the tail and we saw an opportunity here to generate some cash and get our aircraft sales and leasing folks focused on other activity and more profitable ventures. And then lastly, Phase 4, which we're currently in, we expect to grow our businesses by taking advantage of our very strong balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, you will see that the Aviation Service segment sales grew 17%. That's organic growth largely driven by the growth in our supply chain businesses as well as improvements in our MRO. We also as you know, announced in Q1 of this fiscal year that we have closed down our Hot Springs operations. We are moving that work over to Oklahoma City. Our goal there is to just figure out how to maximize our footprint and drive more margin through our service businesses. Now the Expeditionary Service segment saw a sales decline of 51% on a year-over-year basis largely driven by lower -- fewer flying positions in airlift, but also lower revenues at mobility just reflecting reduced demand from the DoD for those types of products. But we do anticipate that this is at a bottom point for that business and we are hopeful that things will turn in our favor, more in our favor in that business as this year kind of progresses. The Airlift business did incur losses during the period as we continued to transition assets from Afghanistan into other theatres. We have incurred program startup costs and costs associated with repositioning some of the assets. But we also, on the positive we've been awarded over $500 million in new contract awards, and as you know we have a very robust deal pipeline. Some of the businesses have not happened as timely as we'd like to see, but it still is out there and we still believe we are in pretty good shape to capture more business in the airlift operation. The balance sheet, on capital structure, so we've reduced our net debt by $446 million on a year-on-year basis, so our net debt-to-capital ratio at the end of May is 10.5% and that's down from about 35% at that point in time prior year. So we are sitting today with close to $450 million of cash in availability, and we feel pretty good about our powder and our ability to go ahead and grow our remaining businesses based on having this stronger balance sheet. We also, as I indicated, bought in some shares. Our share count is down from 39.2 [ph] at the end of the last year to 34.9 [ph] at the end of the latest fiscal year. So we think we have good leverage and really good possibilities and a really good opportunity pool out there that we're looking for. So when I think about where we're heading, which I think is a critical question for you all would be, I want to take our industry-leading supply chain business and MRO businesses where we have performed exceptionally well and grow these businesses. I'd like to grow them geographically. So I'd like to have more content outside the United States, and this is a drive we've been on for the last few years and you may recall last year we were successful in buying out the Sabena supply chain business, Sabena Technics supply chain business, and we're looking at other opportunities along those lines, and having this stronger balance sheet, we feel really good about our ability to go ahead and growth that business. We're also looking at other MRO opportunities. We did announce an MOU with South Africa technical operations to explore doing work in that market. Once upon a time, that was one of the industry-leading MRO facilities, more or less deteriorated over the last few couple of decades and they have a motivation to improve their position, and they sought out AAR as a partner to help them achieve that. So we think we can potentially look at that low cost environment for us to grow more of our -- grow our MRO business outside the United States. The airlift business as I indicated, we have as a result of draw down in Afghanistan we have taken our fleet count from nine different fleet types we will down for five fleet types there once we start operating the AW189s over in the Falklands. So we are looking to grow that business through the, do more of what we're currently doing in Africa. We have placed a couple of aircraft into Iraq. We still do have positions in Afghanistan. We expect those to continue and then we're looking to see if there are some opportunities in the Gulf Coast market which the government provided the equipment that we'll operate on behalf of the government as well as more niche markets that we think are out there for us. And again we have I think an excellent leadership team at the helm of that business and they will win their fair share of business going forward. So in summary, from my vantage point this has been a very momentous year. I think it has been a great year for the Company. If you look at, if I may just for a second, if you look at how we built this Company we looked at the market terrain post 9/11 let's say and we've viewed the need to go ahead and diversify our product mix. Largely coming into 9/11 we were very heavily dependent on the U.S. domestic commercial airline industry. We now believe that that industry is in pretty good of healthy position and the need for us to be as diversified and have as many activities going on was not as prevalent as they had been, say 15 years ago. So, when I look at the portfolio today, I feel very positive about the mix of businesses. I feel exceptionally positive about our balance sheet and our financial flexibility and when I look out into the future I get very excited about what's in front of us as a company. When I think about the year that we're about to go into, clearly the fourth quarter was a lot of moving parts and as I indicated strength in our supply chain and MRO businesses weaknesses in our Expeditionary services. I believe as we enter the new fiscal year we should continue to see the strength in the aviation service side and we should start seeing improvements in our Expeditionary services activity. And as the year progresses as particularly as we start operations in the Falklands that business returns to profitability, decent profits I should say before the year is out. So, I'm going to turn the call over to John and I'll let John describe some of the financial items. Thanks John.
John Fortson:
Thanks David. I trust that you guys have had a chance to read our earnings release. It was a very busy year for AAR and I'll try and put some color around the events that occurred in the fourth quarter and the effects they had both on the quarter and on the full year. Let me start by saying sales for the quarter of $450.8 million were 1.1% less than prior year sales. As David mentioned we had strong results in Aviation Services, but they were not sufficient to offset the decline of our Expeditionary Services segment, which as you guys are aware is heavily leveraged to the defense markets. On the profitability side our results were impacted by the unusual charges a result of us refocusing our platform to product lines that we consider core to our services offering going forward. During the fourth quarter we recorded the following operational charges from our continuing operations. $69.5 million in impairment charges and other losses are related to certain product lines identified as underperforming and are not a part of the Company's strategy going forward. The majority $61.4 million of these actions relate to our Aviation Services segment and include $17.9 million for sold aircraft in the aircraft lease portfolio, $43.6 million in inventory and supply chain in MRO businesses that are in excess to ARR's need or where we're exiting certain lines and $8.2 million for certain aircraft and inventory that are in the Expeditionary Services segment. Besides those, we also took charges related to our recapitalization of our corporate restructuring and they also are in the continuing operations for the fourth quarter. $44.9 million loss recognized in the extinguishment of our high yield debt, $4.5 million in charges related to the corporate office restructuring including writing down certain corporate assets and severance which are recorded in the SG&A line and then $2 million in charges for an early termination of a swap and cap arrangement that's recorded in our interest expense line. As a result of the above actions and in combination with the reduced share count which we anticipate to be $34.9 million for the start of this coming fiscal year, we expect to achieve significantly better operating income to net income conversion. Also during the fourth quarter we recorded the following charges from discontinued operations. We had a pre-tax gain net of transaction expenses in fees of $198.6 million from the sale of the Telair Cargo Group. The gain excludes $35 million of contingent consideration which could be realized prior to December 31, 2015. We also had an additional $11.1 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Precision Systems businesses. The total impact for that for the course of the year is $57.5 million. Fiscal year 2015 adjusted financials for the unusual items will result in $0.87 per share on a continuing basis or $2.51 on a consolidated basis. SG&A as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter was 12.3%. This is higher than the last few quarters and it is due to some extent to the lower sales volume, but also due to the effects of some of the charges that I have outlined. The same is true for the operating margins also negative due to the charges that we took. During the fourth quarter the Company used $52 million in cash flow from operations. This was negatively impacted by the Telair Cargo Group sale tax requirements and was also reduced by some of the cash generation in our Expeditionary Services segment. We had capital expenditures Q4 of $22.6 million. The company paid dividends totaling $3 million. For the year-over-year it was $43 million of cash from operations and our total capital expenditures were $46.3 million. We de-levered significantly and we reduced our net indebtedness as David mentioned by $446 million, ending the year with net debt of $99 million, our net debt-to-EBITDA is less than 1.0 down from 2.3 times last year. Net interest expense for the fourth quarter increased to $7.1 million, but this included as I mentioned before the $2 million associated with the one-time settlement of the cap and swap, our net interest expense numbers will be significantly lower next year as a result of our large debt pay down. Depreciation and amortization including amortization of stock based compensation was $76.9 million for the year. In the fourth quarter, we entered a sale and leaseback transaction for two aircrafts supporting our new contract in the Falklands. In addition, in June we sold one Bell 214 aircraft bringing our total aircrafts held for sale to eight. The current book value of assets held for sale is approximately $14 million. As we’ve alluded to in some of our previous conversations, our effective tax rate for 2015 was 34.4%. Thanks for your attention and I’ll turn the call back over to David for some closing comments.
David Storch:
Thanks John. Let me just say the operational charges that John referred to were taken and the primary motivation there is get our team and organization focused around higher performing opportunities, higher margin opportunities. So we exited certain product lines in our landing gear repair business, we exited certain product lines in our trading activities, all geared again getting people really focused on higher margin opportunities and that’s the theme [ph] you will be hearing from us throughout the year. In any event, let me now turn it back to the moderator to open up for any questions.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn:
Good morning David and John.
David Storch:
Good morning.
Robert Spingarn:
David at a high level, is there a reason you haven’t given us a more specific guidance for 2016?
David Storch:
Yes Rob, what we would like to do is, we would like to let the year kick in, let's start the year. We have a fair amount of variability in our airlift business, and as I’ve indicated, we've won some contracts and we do have some contracts we believe we’re going to win. So there is a little bit of far enough range at this stage that I think we prefer not to put out the numbers at this point.
Robert Spingarn:
Can I ask you then just a couple of more specific questions, at least it may give us some help in that area, one would be the $500 million in new contracts for airlift, what period of time do those cover?
David Storch:
Well, the largest contract is the Falklands contract which is $339 million, and that’s over a 12-year period.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay.
David Storch:
And then the balance of the contracts are three years and one contract is a five-year.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then in terms of the fleet, are you down to how many aircraft are you down to now, I think you said 21 are in contract service?
John Fortson:
Hi Rob, it’s John, yes so when we talk, we talk in terms of contract and revenue generating positions. We finished the year with 19 positions. Sitting here today, we are at 21.
Robert Spingarn:
Do you have a rough idea where you expect to close out the year -- if or range perhaps that maybe reflects…?
John Fortson:
Yes and so, we based on current deal flow, based on current contracts, we’re looking at 32 at the end of the year.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Okay. And then how do we think about margins going forward in the two businesses? Do you think as volumes improve in aviation we can get some margin lift there? You’ve done the consolidation, I assume that starts to help at some point, are you doing that in August? And then how do we think about the profitability or the incremental profitability of the new work in Expeditionary? Thanks.
David Storch:
Yes, so we have historically had very strong margins in the Expeditionary segment that’s going to be volume based, so as the volume picks up, we’ll start seeing margin throughput from that business. So, right now in both businesses, in Expeditionary, you’re at the kind of at the bottom point of the historical results cycle, if you will. In terms of the MRO in supply chain, I would anticipate that we’ll see better margins throughout the year. So the supply chain margins will improve as volumes grow as well as the MRO. Then the MRO, the move out of Hot Springs saves us about $1.5 million a year or adds $1.5 million a year to the margin, the gross margin for that section of our business.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay, thank you.
David Storch:
Yep.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Hi, good morning David and John. Thanks for taking my questions here.
David Storch:
Good morning. Sure.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Just to followup on Rob’s last question, any disruption that we would see over the next quarter to as Hot Springs shuts down or I guess any other one-time charges that might be kind of residual over the next quarter or two?
David Storch:
You know what, the one-time charge from that is what about $1 million from the shutdown of Hot Springs. I believe that for the most part, I can’t think of any other charges that we see coming at us. We will be selling some airlift aircraft. The net effect though of the sale of the aircraft is about I would say somewhere between $18 million and $22 million of sales will probably be neutral, we wouldn’t expect losses, if anything we might have slight gains from those sales. So we don’t expect any other noise other than John referred to the tale to the Darwin, I’m sorry for the Telair transaction of up to $35 million pattern that would be a positive impact.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay, that’s helpful.
David Storch:
That 18 to 22 Kevin includes inventory that’s associated with some of those aircraft down there.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Right, okay got it. Yep. And then just touching on Airlift, so you added two positions to go from 19 to 21 post the close of the quarter here. Can you just help us, I mean should we expect to see a sequential growth in Airlift revenues as we go into Q1 because of that, or are those not active yet, so the revenue is not going to flow through? I know obviously it will have some impact, negative impact on the gross margin line for startup costs that you mentioned, just trying to get a handle on what to expect in terms of the revenue from those two positions?
Timothy Romenesko:
Yes, so Kevin this is Tim Romenesko. So, yeah and so, we really see the revenue ramp later in the fiscal year when the larger programs kick in. In the early part of the fiscal year, we will be incurring costs associated with the startup of the Falklands program, and that includes taking on the new aircraft and includes the pilot training, building up the maintenance capability. So those costs are fairly significant and will kind of mute some of the positive impact of the new aircraft that we’re bringing on board. But once we get into, once we get the Falkland’s contract ramping and we get the cumulative effect of the other aircraft coming on, that business will be generating decent returns and will be kind of back to not exactly where it was before, but approaching its peak performance.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay, thanks Tim. And then the last one from me and I’ll jump back in queue here. If you could just give an update on kind of what you’re seeing at Lake Charles in terms of capacity and business development there? And then maybe a quick update on progress at Rockford?
John Holmes:
Sure. This is John Holmes. I am responsible for the Aviation Services Group. At Lake Charles, we’re still on a hiring phase there. We went through quite a ramp up period in FY 2015. We expect to get to at least a breakeven operation there in FY 2016. We’ve got some significant programs starting with Delta Airlines that will be ramping up in the fall and so we’re looking forward to the positive impact there out of Lake Charles. And Hot Springs, the consolidation actually will be done by the end of this month and we’ll have exited, so the main customer that was in Rockford was Air Wisconsin there transitioning to Oklahoma City and then by the end of August we’ll have exited the operations in Hot Springs.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay, thanks.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of J.B. Groh with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
J.B. Groh:
Hey thanks guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hey could you talk about this organic growth in supply chain and MRO, could you maybe break that out between the two businesses just generally?
David Storch:
Can you repeat that, can you just repeat that please and we weren’t able to hear you.
J.B. Groh:
Oh, I’m sorry, the organic growth in the Aviation Services business, can you break that out between kind of what you saw in supply chain versus MRO is one of those stronger than the other and is there new programs at supply chain that’s driving that growth or is it just pure organic growth?
David Storch:
Yes, well so we don’t comment on the individual necessarily, but suffice to say the growth in supply chain was strong, was very strong.
J.B. Groh:
So was there new programs that were driving that or was it just…?
David Storch:
Yes new programs and you may recall, I would say about a year ago we entered into an agreement with Eaton and we've started taking delivery of the inventory for Eaton and we've started making sales from the - in supporting the Eaton products during this period. And program activity was strong and across the board we had strength in the supply chain businesses, as we did in the MRO business.
J.B. Groh:
Okay.
David Storch:
A 17% organic growth in this period if you check around the horns, there are very few companies growing at that rate in our industry.
J.B. Groh:
Agreed, agreed, yes. John, can you maybe give us now that we've got some charges to sort of a run rate on SG&A, what is the expectation there?
John Fortson:
Yes, I mean look, I think our SG&A is going to revert into the sort of 9% to 10% range where it should do a little bit better than we have historically, but I think for modelling I would sort of assume that.
J.B. Groh:
Okay. That’s all I have. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stan Mann with Mann Family Investments. Your line is open.
Stan Mann:
Thank you. Good job gentlemen. I have a couple of questions, David. One use of cash, do you see the cash being used for acquisitions, more stock buyback, have you got a feel or outlook for that?
David Storch:
Well Stan, I like how you always get right to the key elements. You’ve been very consistent with that over the years. So listen, we’re going to keep our options open, Stan. The - obviously in the period just ended, we spent $150 million on share repurchases. I believe we are seeing a good deal flow and opportunity. So we will probably have probably I would say a very balanced approach between returning capital and opportunistically investing. I mean the leverage - I joined the Company we have leveraged ratio of 40% debt-to-total capitalization and we’ve really never been below 30 since I’ve been at the Company and here we are today at 11%. So we have a lot of flexibility and we’re going to hopefully make some intelligent moves here.
Stan Mann:
Okay. My second question maybe looking out quite a distance, but do you have any goal or feel for what your operating margins will go to in future years, I mean you are kind of targeting or…?
David Storch:
Yes, we have a three-year plan that gets us up to our 10% objective.
Stan Mann:
Oh, well that’s really optimistic.
David Storch:
Right, right but it is real and we have to win some business, and yes but we feel we can get there.
Stan Mann :
Okay. Good job.
David Storch:
By the way we've lowered our corporate expense by $8.2 million in the quarter. So going forward our corporate expense will be as I said lowered by $8.2 million.
Stan Mann:
That’s a good number. It’s hard to discern what the exact numbers are, but that’s really quite a move in the right direction.
David Storch:
Yes.
Stan Mann :
Thank you. Good job.
David Storch:
Yes, thanks.
Operator:
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is a followup from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn:
Hi, good morning again.
David Storch:
Good morning.
Robert Spingarn:
So back to the comment on the healthy airline industry, we’ve all seen is how is that translating in MRO, you mentioned a moment ago that supply chain is really the driver in the segment, but in MRO, is there a way to think about same-store sales so to speak in terms of growth?
David Storch:
I mean the, the way to think about the MRO is probably the hours of maintenance and the cumulative man hours and that number has been a little bit down and give or take it’s around the $5 million level and so that’s one of the reasons why we took the action we did with Hot Springs to reduce some of our footprint and get more productivity our of our remaining footprint. So we’re also trying to find the lowest cost solution. One of the reasons why we moved into Lake Charles was to get a lot [ph] capacity at a low expense. Now we've got to make sure we can, as John Holmes indicated make sure we can get the workforce in place to make that business hum.
Robert Spingarn:
So David, maybe you can help me reconcile, we got seat miles raising 5%, 6%, 7% depending on where you’re looking and why would maintenance hours be down?
David Storch:
Just where the aircrafts are in the repair cycle as well as capacity in North America.
Robert Spingarn:
Is there any element of fleet age playing a role here?
David Storch:
Not, not, really I think the average age, the fleet age I think has been, again using my historical knowledge, I don’t think that has been more than a one year average age variation over the last 25 years.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay.
David Storch:
But, if I mean the average age is, and don’t quote me exactly that’s, if it’s 12.9 years or 13.2 or 12.7 it really doesn’t make, it really doesn’t play a factor here.
Robert Spingarn:
Well, I mean a lot of airlines have been addressing or avoiding maintenance by parking aircraft that are due for heavy checks, I mean has that been an element?
David Storch:
We haven’t really seen much of that.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. And then just a last question on this David, so it sounds like your approach to guiding for this year reflects some of the variability in Expeditionary you want to get a little further into the year before you look there or make specific targets, but on the aviation side is there some framework we can think about in terms of growth expectation and sales expectations?
David Storch:
Well, we’re looking at double-digit sales growth and we’re looking at double-digit earnings growth from those businesses.
Robert Spingarn:
And again this is driven by supply chain rather than MRO?
David Storch:
No, we’re looking for improvement in MRO as well, so we’re looking for improvement or growth, I should say in both.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Okay. And then last question…
David Storch:
MRO is not earning at peak levels right now. So we have had higher earnings levels at MRO than we are currently experiencing.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay, I was going to ask you just one last question on this. John and I’ve talked in the past about capacity utilization, where would you say you would be once you close the facility you’re closing in terms of MRO?
David Storch:
At 70%.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay, okay. Thank you.
David Storch:
Yep.
Operator:
Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Hi, thanks guys, thanks for taking my followup here.
David Storch:
Sure.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
You mentioned some restructuring in the landing gear business, just kind of wondering if you can maybe give us some color on what happened there and if you’re seeing any pickup there in terms of the cyclicality of that business?
David Storch:
Yes, so we are, we have exited certain product lines that we viewed non-productive and we are seeing an uptick in the cycle. We expect that to kick in more so as the fiscal year moves forward. So, think of it as a 10-year cycle. So if you look at deliveries at the factories 10 years back they were starting to pick up in the ‘05 time period and so we should start seeing ‘05, ‘06. We should start seeing you know improvement in that operation.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay, thanks David, and then just my last question I guess. Looking at Airlift and the contracting environment, is there a specific reason you can point to that the contracts are taking longer to get through the finish line here than kind of what you had originally thought?. And then as a second part of that question, is there any impact on how that plays out that you see from the FY ‘16 federal budget process or is that kind of separate from that I guess?
David Storch:
No, I think it’s all kind of connected. My sense is that, there are clearly operational needs that the customers had, that the customers has, customer being USTRANSCOM for the most part. So just there are delays in funding and preparations I believe that have had some impact. So yes, I mean it’s kind of, - I don’t think anything specific to AAR that you won’t be seeing in other government contracting environments.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Great, thanks.
David Storch:
Yes.
Operator:
Thank you. And that does conclude today’s question-and-answer portion. I would like to turn the call back over to David Storch for any closing remarks.
David Storch:
Thank you very much for your participation today, and I look forward to our next call in September. Have a nice afternoon. Bye-bye.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."

Operator:
Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2015 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligations to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch. You may begin.
David Storch:
Good morning. Thank you and thanks to all for joining us here today to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2015 results. As you can tell, a lot has being going on at the company and I'm pleased to announce that we've completed several strategic initiatives for the company and we continue to work on other funds as well. So, we finalized the sale of the Telair Cargo Group. The proceeds we received last week were 705 million. We have 20 million that's in escrow awaiting determination on a particular program and the results from that particular program. We’ve refinanced last week our revolving credit facility. We upped availability to 500 million and we got improved terms. We now essentially have taken anywhere from - let's call it 25 basis points to 75 basis points depending on level and where we are at in terms of cost interest rate reduction on that facility. We commenced this morning the redemption of our $375 million high yield notes. Now we will pay a makehold but the annual interest rate savings by doing this is about $23 million per year. Earlier in the quarter you saw where we announced that our Board has authorized the purchase of $250 million worth of our shares. We also announced the two segments that will be going in the market with. The one segment aviation services will be comprised by our supply chains and MRO businesses and our expeditionary services businesses will be our airlift and mobility businesses. We continue to see growth, solid growth in our aviation service businesses. I believe we have communicated sales increase of just right around 10%, I think it was 9.9% to be precise and over 30% growth in our gross profit margin. The parts business is particularly strong. The MRO business is improving and you may recall within MRO we have our heavy maintenance, we have component maintenance and we have landing gear maintenance. We're seeing good improvement not withstanding competitive pressures, we are seeing good improvement and results coming across that group of businesses. As you can see our airlift business as we've discussed in the past is more or less in transition mode. Last year at this time we had - we started last year's third quarter with 35 flying positions. We ended last year’s third quarter with 25 flying positions. Today we have 19 flying positions and we expect to be at 21 by the end of the - our fiscal year. And you can see, so we’ve had a little bit of rotation, we’ve had assets coming out of Afghanistan. We've been successfully in redeploying some of those assets into the DOD down in Africa and we also recently won our first UN contract. Don't get too excited on the UN contract from a profit contribution vantage point as much as may mean in terms of opportunities for the companies. We will be the first U.S. operator operating for them at least in recent history - at least in recent times. So it was a win that we have been working on for quite sometime. It's only one asset at this time but it is directionally I think a good indicator for our company. We are in the process of selling certain assets that we no longer are looking to reposition, we had some assets that we had classified for sales that we actually pulled back into inventory because we think that's a pretty good opportunity placing those particular assets. On the assets we have four sales. We expect to sell five of the – four of the assets in this quarter and hopefully close from a cash standpoint as well. So when you look at the businesses in Q3 in there composite, sales were down 5%, when you consider from an ongoing basis - from a going forward basis. But when you consider the reductions that we've had at the airlift operation in this quarter on a year-over-year basis, I think you can see it was actually a pretty decent quarter for the rest of our businesses. We will attempt to walk you through kind of what businesses would have look like had we not consummated the sales so you can get to some kind of an apples-to-apples comparison. So you can see we reported $0.05. When you take into consideration of the one-timers including adjustments for interest of the onetime adjustments come out to about $0.12. If you look at the airlift quarter on a quarter basis, if you look at the change on year-over-year basis, it's about $0.15. When you look at Telair, it's about $0.15. That would bring you up to about $0.47 and then when you back out the losses from [ANIS] [ph] is about $0.08, it would take you up to around $0.39. So, that’s our best effort at a reconciliation. We are entering the fourth quarter. I would say and as you look at next - fourth quarter will also add some noise, the noise will be a $200 million gain from the sale of Telair businesses. We will have a charge-off for the backhaul on the high yield notes, which we’ve communicated. And there may be certain other things that happened as a result of our efforts to commence in New Year with a nice fresh look at our business. So we feel we're in good position with our businesses, despite in MRO businesses, think of those businesses being aftermarket, independent aftermarket providers. We believe we have - at in least North America very solid leadership position in these markets. We're looking to expand more internationally and looking at various different spots as we've done in the past. Our expeditionary businesses which are really more or less type of supporting U.S. and other friendly government activities outside the United States, those businesses, mobility seems to be relatively stable and airlift as I indicated is going through a series of - is going through a transition out of Afghanistan but there are other fair amount of opportunities that we are looking at. So the building pipeline is strong and we have talked in the past about one particular large program which continues to be out there for the company. On the balance sheet, one more time we feel really good about how the banks view these moves and the feedback they gave us which shows up in terms of improved terms on our revolver I think speaks the volumes to what we are doing and I think in general we feel pretty good about where we stand. So, I think with that let me open up the calls to questions that you may have.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert Spingarn:
Good morning. Couple of things, with regard to Airlift, and the modest negative margin in the quarter, is this the breakeven level 19 positions? How do we think about that? And I think last quarter you answered a question, you thought you had a 100% visibility into 23 positions this quarter, we are obviously behind that/or below that level and it just seems like this business is either slow to recover or something is tough to see. Could you explain or frame the visibility that you do have?
David Storch:
I think the business has been little slower to recover. Keep in mind now, I believe part of those 23 were also the two that we have coming online later this year with the placement of two aircraft with the British Ministry of Defense against a ten year contract. So, I think it has been a little slower to recover than we had hoped. We have had a series of protest around certain wins that we have had and we have had a couple of programs that had been a little longer to materialize. But again Bob I would say that we feel good about the business. It's unfortunate that we had such a good year last year I guess, and the comparisons will be difficult but we will - you will see improved results coming out of that business.
Robert Spingarn:
So at this are we at a breakeven low? Are you close to where is 19 the number there, and what's the cash profile here? Is this business cash flow positive at this level?
David Storch:
The business has historically been extremely cash flow positive. So it's generated fair amount of cash for the company. At current, it's relatively flat from a cash flow standpoint. We will generate cash with the sale of the assets albeit in the $11 million to $12 million range. And we do anticipate that we will - probably this quarter be a net investor but the business should be generating positive cash out into '16.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay, and then just a last thing, could you give us a rough mix within expeditionary. The airlift versus the mobility, just an updated mix?
David Storch:
Call it 50-50. It's a little bit more airlift than it is mobility but approximately let's call it 50-50.
Robert Spingarn:
And profit wise and cash flow wise, how do we think about those two pieces?
David Storch:
There is a lot of different ways to look in these businesses. If we look at them snapshot wise, we’re getting more cash coming out of mobility. If we look it from a - let’s call it a five year horizon, they've both been very strong profit contributors to the company. Airlift at its peak would contribute far more cash than with mobility but mobility at its peak also contributed a fair amount of cash.
Robert Spingarn:
Okay. Thanks David.
David Storch:
They both by the way should add - they both are leadership positions in their respective markets. The both market I would say are going through - airlift a little bit more of the transition because of the heavy dependence we had on the Afghanistan market but both businesses are leaders in their respective markets.
Robert Spingarn:
Right. Thank you.
Operator:
And our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Your line is now open.
Larry Solow:
Good morning. Just on - touch on airlift again, just in terms of - so you positioned down about 20%, the revenue was down about 45%, or is that the expeditionary services dropped revenue, was that all airlift or was there continue drops in mobility that's a first question?
David Storch:
A little drop in mobility but mostly coming at airlift.
Larry Solow:
And is that sort of - the positions were down I guess the ones that remain I guess just less flying hours too so that sort of explain what's down?
David Storch:
Is less flying hours and we had as you recall Larry, we had the S-92s in prior period, and S-92s were huge contributors because it build more for them and they flew more. And the S-92s are now parked looking for a new home.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And what's the outlook for mobility? Is that sort of - you think reaching a trough and flattening?
David Storch:
I would say you'll have periods where it will be a little bit stronger and periods where it will be a little bit weaker. So I think it’s kind of bouncing around. It's still has a nice profitability, still a profitable business. But I would say its giving us a good return on capital but it’s just bouncing around.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And now the Telair deal is closed, I know you had a couple of sort of capital structure initiatives. Any clarity any thought on how you view share purchases and –
David Storch:
It's definitely in the mix. So it’s really just we’re just trying to get our thoughts together and figure out the best approach.
Larry Solow:
Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator:
And our next question comes from the line of Tyler Hojo with Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.
Tyler Hojo:
Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just to go back David your commentary surrounding free cash flow, I guess you talked about being a net investor in terms of cash in Q4. Was that specifically geared for the airlift business or the business overall?
David Storch:
I wouldn't expect the business overall be cash flow positive in Q4.
Tyler Hojo:
Okay. Got it.
David Storch:
I think we have certain challenges around airlift as we position assets or every time we win a contract, we have to put some investments - minor investment relatively so, but still investments in the assets and push-off slightly on the assets as well. So I think Q4 for airlift because of the sale of the assets we have pending, I would expect probably from all end probably expect it to be cash flow positive from an operating vantage point it may not be.
Tyler Hojo:
Okay, got it. And in regards to kind of the aircraft numbers within airlift, I think you said four are expected to be sold in Q4, how many are up for sale right now?
John Fortson:
There is 12 available for sale right now. So we last reported to you guys the number was 16, we had talked about potentially taking it up to 18, but we've actually returned some S-61s to the active fleet for use in future mission. So we're sitting at 12 today.
Tyler Hojo:
Okay, got it. And then just one last one on airlift I promise. When we talk about kind of going back to Rob's question about where the breakeven is for this business, is there a number or is it really more predicated on the assets you have in Afghanistan and how heavily utilized they are?
David Storch:
I think it’s kind of a mixture of the number of flying positions plus the number of hours they're flying, plus the type of assets that they're. So I think as a point where we’re at right now, we’re kind of at that point that you’re talking about that breakeven point. So, yes, I think it's a mix of all of the above.
Tyler Hojo:
Okay. And in regards to kind of the new contracts that you're winning, I mean we talked about UN being kind of not as profitable as some of the legacy sort of contracts. Can you win business that's kind of comparable in profitability profile to kind of some of the legacy stuff is that -
David Storch:
I believe so yes, I believe that you may have - there were some very favorable pricing list, say, at a stage in the Afghanistan buildup, that pricing is probably not available today. But I would say that we have better pricing opportunities that are equal to profit opportunities that we're looking at, yes.
Tyler Hojo:
Okay, great. Thanks for that. And just lastly from me, no real kind of commentary from you guys just regards to some of the MRO growth initiatives, so just curious what’s going on, what’s the latest and greatest in regards to kind of the wide-body growth initiative?
David Storch:
We’re still working at hard, I mean we had a tough quarter in late trials, we have lot of build-up cost in late trials during the period notwithstanding those, we still had earnings growth from the businesses. We would expect that we will gain more traction, positive traction I should say this quarter than last. And we feel, we are out there trying to win more wide-body business.
Tyler Hojo:
Okay. So gaining traction is just basically winning new customers, is that?
David Storch:
Yes. And then performing to our expectation.
Tyler Hojo:
Got it, okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
Operator:
And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Looking at the margin expansion in the quarter in aviation services, you talked about scope helping out there. David, just wondering if there is anything else you can kind of point to in a little bit more detail regarding the margins there and how you could potentially generate additional margin expansion in that business?
David Storch:
I think for the time being, we are seeing - I think we’re mapping from scale. So our cost structure is based relatively flat and we had slight increase in cost deploying those businesses. We had nice progress in volume improvement, so we’re gaining a little bit of scale that’s working on our favor. But we also – we are seeing improvement in our landing gear business for instance. So we’re gaining more volume coming through those that shop, our component shops are doing better. So I think across the board you’re seeing improvements in operating. Now we did have aching in Lake Charles, so Lake Charles was a negative contributor during the period which is not unusual this early in the build-up phase of one of our MROs.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
So you’re - just touching on some of the I guess sub businesses of aviation services, it sounds like years coming back kind of as you expected and the trough looks to be in the rear view mirror there?
David Storch:
Yes. It’s slower than we expected and it's not as steep as we had hoped, but it is recovering.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. And then in the press release you talked about using the new capital based kind of growth the existing businesses, what are you guys looking at now in terms of potential growth avenues, whether domestic versus international MRO versus supply chain, any kind of color you can talk about in terms of opportunities for growth?
David Storch:
So we’re looking at the supply chain business has been exceptionally strong. We are playing around with a few different international activities. You may recall last year we’ve acquired the inventory from Sabena Technics, that turned out to be a very good move for the company, very positive move. So we’re looking at other opportunities along those lines, and the pipeline is pretty good.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. And then last one from me and then I'll jump back in queue. Can you talk at all about the kind of pace of the debt redemption and when - I think you mentioned $23 million of annualized savings in terms of kind of timing and the cadence for that what you’re expecting?
David Storch:
So we put out a - I don't think it's called a tender, but we put down a operative buy to redeem, a redemption I guess is the right word, a redemption on these bonds today and that is a 30 day process.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. Great, thanks.
Operator:
And our next question comes from the line of Stan Manny with Manny Family Investors. Your line is now open.
Stan Manny:
Hi all, Stan Manny. David, the use of cash that's coming, do you kind of identified the debt buyback, you identified the stock potential buyback and then there is - you’re generating cash flow continuously while you’re operating. So are there any specific, I know there has been some general questions but are there any specific plans to buy or add assets at all that you’re closed to?
David Storch:
I mean there is the always the possibility right, I mean its kind of the nature of our business is we’re always looking at opportunities. So in terms of close it's hard from me to - your definition of close Stan and mine might be different but we have stopped in the pipeline let me put it that way.
Stan Manny:
Okay. In MRO what seems to be a growing business and your prime asset, the concentrated assets, the area that do not represented very much is international, so can we expect anything in international build-out in MRO?
David Storch:
It's not for lack of effort. We have to find the right situation. I mean MRO has its kind of subtleties like every business does, but going international is not as easy as it sounds because you're dealing with different cultures and different work habits and things of that nature. Our view is that, yes, we are interested in international MRO. We have gone down numerous paths with different local potential partners, none of which have materialized but we are still out there stirring up the horn nest to try to find the right opportunity.
Stan Manny:
But you are involved. You are involved in Saudi Arabia, or UAE, on the build-out - you have reasonability for build-out over MRO truly I believe.
David Storch:
Yes, that's correct. But that's not – we won’t be operating that facility. We just - they are just buying our expertise on setting up the facility.
Stan Manny:
Okay. But you would not be operating it?
David Storch:
No. That's the - UAE government will be the operator, we are just - they procured certain capability from us that we are providing them.
Stan Manny:
Okay. So my last question on buyback. Is there a legal career that you can start buying stock to blackout some times you can. Can you define what the career that you could buyback stock or when it starts by SEC rules or whatever?
David Storch:
Well, there are rules and there are laws and we abide by every one of them. So it depends on the structure and we are right now in the blackout because we tend to allow investors 24-hours or so to absorb the information. So yes, we will abide by every law there is.
Stan Manny:
Okay. But the period – what I'm trying to get understand is, when does it open up possibility so you can legally start buying?
David Storch:
I think tomorrow.
Stan Manny:
Okay. Well good luck. Thank you very much.
Operator:
Thank you. And I'm showing no further question at this time.
David Storch:
Okay. Thanks everyone for participating. And have a nice day.
Operator:

Operator:
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2015, Second Quarter Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligations to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch:
Well, thank you very much everybody. We start today with a sunny day in Chicago, but no longer. And I want to welcome everybody to our second quarter call. I'm sitting here with a room full of my friends and compatriots, Tim Romenesko and John Fortson are with me and available to answer calls as we get into the call section of this call. Let me begin by saying that on balance, we had a good quarter far from great, but nevertheless, under all the conditions in which we are operating, we think we had a good quarter. In Aviation Services we had a mixed bag. Within our Aviation Service segment, the supply chain sales were up 15% year-over-year driven largely by strength in our program and aftermarket parts supports business. Our recently opened Brussels Hub is performing well and allowing us to increase our market presence in Europe, Middle East and Africa. We see continued strong demand for our unique supply chain services from airlines and maintenance providers across the globe. Our Defense Logistics business is also seeing some positive impacts as a result of increasing flying hours on certain other programs that we support. So for the second half of the year, we expect continued double-digit hopefully as high as 20% year-over-year growth from our Aviation Services supply chain business. MRO, we experienced year-over-year weakness although sequential improvement and we are entering the second half with strong bookings. So during the period, MRO sales declined 11.5% though as I indicated there was a slight up tick from sequential basis and year-over-year decline is largely due to lower engineering service work, which I believe we discussed in the past. We are seeing more customer interest in work at our newest MRO facility in Lake Charles both narrow body and wide body. And we expect the balance of fiscal year; we do expect sales growth in the mid to high single digits for our MRO business. Airlift within our Aviation Service sector continues to transition. We in the second quarter sales are down considerably in the 40% range as we had 17 aircrafts under contract as supposed to 40 back in May of 2014. For the balance of the year, we expect continued year-over-year sales declines, however, we are working multiple proposals and are expected to hear and hopefully announce positively in the next 30 days or so. Technology products, we are seeing strength in our Telair cargo group. We had 20% increase in sales on a year-over-year basis driven by growth in commercial products as well as deliveries of the A400M cargo systems. We expect continued strong year-over-year sales growth at Telair cargo group throughout the second half of the year. And the growth rates we expect are should be equal to or greater than the 20% growth we posted in this quarter. We continue to see reduction in our mobility and machine parts group, 23% reduction in mobility products and additional reduction in our machine parts business as well. But, for the balance for the year, we expect declines at these units, but not at the rates we experienced in the second quarter of this year. So final thoughts, some of you may have seen Thomson Reuters article, it's not our intension to comment on that article which – I'd be – but at the same token, I have indicated in the past that we are looking at taking action or actioning underperforming units. In our Technology Product segment, we continued down that path, while at the same time, I believe we are performing the proper function by as we do always performing – growing evaluation of our business units towards the goal of streamlining and focusing our business and also improving our returns on capital. So with that, I will turn the call over to my team colleague, John Fortson to fill you in on more of the details.
John Fortson:
Thanks David. I trust that each of you had a chance to read our earnings release and on this call, I will just review a few key points with regards to our financial performance. Our consolidated gross profit margin this quarter was 16% down from 16.8% in the prior year period, this performance translated into a 16.9% margin for Aviation Services and 13% for Technology Products. SG&A as a percentage of sales in the first quarter was 9.6% that's slightly higher than 9.5% in the prior year period. However, in the aggregate, our SG&A expenses declined $4 million over the prior year period reflecting continued cost control efforts across the company. Our operating margin for the quarter was 6.6%. During the second quarter, we generated $16 million in cash from operations and our capital expenditures were $8 million. We paid out $0.075 per shares in dividends this quarter. Net interest expense for the second quarter declined to $9.5 million from $10.2 million in the prior year. Our net interest expense numbers continued to decline as we focus on paying down debt. On a year-over-year basis, our net debt is lowered by approximately $40 million. And during this quarter, we retired $30 million of our 1.625% convertible note. Depreciation and amortization including amortization and stock-based compensation was $19.8 million. For the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 32.7%, per our guidance in July; we expected to remain at this rate throughout the balance of the year. We entered the quarter with 39.1 million shares and the diluted share count. We did repurchase 70,000 shares at an aggregate value of $1.7 million during the quarter. Thank you for your attention. And I will turn the call to the operator for Q&A.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Larry Solow [CJS Securities].
Larry Solow:
Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you can comment, David, on the dramatic drop in oil prices. Obviously, helps your commercial customers. Just in terms of the dynamic with some of the newer aircraft that have been coming online, because there's more economic incentive, but now with the oil coming down so much, maybe some of these fuel-efficient – the lack of fuel efficiency in the older aircraft, could they maybe stick around for a little bit longer? And would that directly help your business?
David Storch:
First of all, I think it's too early to tell. So the oil prices have dropped precipitously here in the last 90 days or so. So I'm not so certain that we have a trend yet. Clearly, our customers are benefiting from this low oil price rate. But I'm not certain at this point that's caused them to adjust their long-term fleet planning. Now, that said, our business as you can see – our business supporting the world's fleet is growing quite steadily and at very attractive rates, keeping in mind that all these growth rates are organic. So I believe, we are in a good position expanding our business I think nicely. A suite of products that we offer in supply chain arena in particular are very appealing. And I believe the spread we have now in terms of the capability in North America for airfare maintenance is also quite strong. So yes, I think that the economic environment is more friendly today than it's been in a while for the airlines. And as that continues whether they take on new aircrafts during that I believe we are well positioned.
Larry Solow:
Okay. And then you talked about some of the ramping of the aviation supply, some of those contracts. Can you comment how – I guess the two contracts at Eaton and the one at Unison are those still progressing in a positive direction?
David Storch:
Yes. Unison has been placed for a period of time and it's I think fairly steady.
Larry Solow:
Okay.
David Storch:
And the Eaton programs are in their launch phase and still in a build up phase. We are probably more of a net investor at this point in time than a net beneficiary. But, I would anticipate that as the other distributors work through their inventories, they will be in a good position to start seeing ramp in sales.
Larry Solow:
Okay. Then just lastly, you gave some nice itemized guidance over the back half of the year. Putting it all together, and I know sometimes you put annual guidance and don't necessarily look to change it out if you don't have to. But fair to say your full-year outlook is sort of within – where it's similar to what it was last quarter?
David Storch:
Yes. I think as we sit here today, we don't see anything different from what we saw at that point when we adjusted earlier in the year.
Larry Solow:
Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thanks.
David Storch:
Yes. Thank you.
Operator:
The next question comes from Tyler Hojo [Sidoti & Company].
Tyler Hojo:
Good evening. Just – I totally understand you don't want to comment on the Reuters report. But, David, you did tell us that you would be willing to kind of update us on kind of some potential divestitures, I think, towards the end of the year. And I guess what I'm wondering is, it seems like cargo-loading systems and kind of the Telair acquisition just in general has been one of the better performing assets that you bought. I mean is there any reason to think that that's not kind of a core, in terms of what AIR does going forward?
David Storch:
Well, I think everything that we have in our portfolio today is core. So we are reviewing all our businesses this core. I think we are looking at how that we go ahead and maximize our investments. And so I think we are performing normal functions in that regard. And we will continue to do so. So I don't see any change in that regard.
Tyler Hojo:
Okay. That's fair. And then just in regards to aero structures and the initiatives there, I know kind of the strategy was to kind of try and improve the operational efficiency of those assets and then kind of try and determine what to do with that business. How have those businesses been performing? Are we back into the profit range now or still kind of where we were?
David Storch:
Yes. I don't believe we have seen much change in those businesses. So it's a little bit frustrating from our side. But as I indicated by the end of the year we should be in a position to talk more specifically.
Tyler Hojo:
Okay. Got it. And then just as it relates to your prior guidance, I think you are looking for your Airlift business to grow to 23 positions in the third quarter, is that still the expectation?
David Storch:
Yes.
Tyler Hojo:
Okay. Got it. And how feasibility do you have into that?
David Storch:
I think 100%.
Tyler Hojo:
Okay. Well, that makes it easy.
David Storch:
Yes.
Tyler Hojo:
All right, good. And then just one follow-up on the last questioners like of questioning just in regards to oil. What are you seeing – I mean with the drop in oil line, I'm assuming kind of your ability to kind of benefit from the surplus parts market becomes a little bit more challenging. But just what's your view on that? And then also I guess as it relates to your leasing portfolio, what do you think kind of the implications are for asset values there and does that potentially get you thinking that maybe you look to sell a few more of those assets in the back half of the year?
David Storch:
Well, first of all, I view the reduction in oil prices right now as positive. I would be hopeful that the price level will settle – if it settles in the range where we are today, I believe that's very positive for our industry and for ourselves. It's a little bit difficult knowing – it's a little bit difficult to pinpoint where oil prices may fall. But, nevertheless, I believe that the state of the airline industry when oil prices are in the 100 range were very positive. And I think with the price of the barrel being in the 55 to 60 range, it's even that much more positive. So I look at the industry. I look at the U.S. commercial airline industry as probably being the healthy as it's been since I have been in the industry. And it's helping us think about – think through our strategy as we look at the – how well they are doing and what their prospects look like. So I hope I'm answering your question. In terms of values on inventory, we are getting – we are able to make good investments. We have made some solid investments this quarter, while we still generate cash from our ops and free cash. So I believe that we have our tentacles out in the worldwide market. And I think we are in a good position to benefit as fleets grow and as fleets change. So yes, I think oil is just – the price of oil I think is contributing to what was already a fairly conducive environment for the things that we do.
Tyler Hojo:
Okay. Thanks a lot for that. Appreciate it.
Operator:
The next question comes from Kevin Ciabattoni [KeyBanc Capital Markets].
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Hi. Good afternoon guys.
David Storch:
Hi, Kevin.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Just real quick on airlift, I know – if my numbers are right, you finished last quarter at 19 positions, and it was – if I heard correctly down to 17 at the end of Q2 here. Just wondering if that was an expected drop, I know you said you still expect to get to the 23. I was just curious if that was baked in, because I was under the impression it was going to stay fairly flat?
John Fortson:
Hi, Kevin. It's John Fortson. So we did have two aircrafts that were descoped that were not anticipated. So we technically finished the quarter at 17. But, we have actually picked up two aircrafts since quarter end. So we are back to 19.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. I mean –
John Fortson:
It's in different geographies. Sorry…
Kevin Ciabattoni:
For those in Afghanistan?
John Fortson:
No. It's in a different geography.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay.
John Fortson:
But, yes, I mean we are tracking these obviously very, very carefully. The two that came out were not expected. But, we have actually had two incremental wins. So…
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Any update on the aircraft held for sale, I think it was 15 at the end of last quarter. I was just wondering if you guys have made any progress there?
David Storch:
Yes. So we are sitting at 16 right now. We have had some progress. We haven't actually sold the aircraft. But, if we think we are getting closer on a couple and we feel like we will get some out of the door by in this quarter.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay, perfect. I know it's not a huge piece of the business, but engineering services, I was wondering if you can give us some color on how you think that shakes out in the back half of the year. I mean I guess its one part of the business we didn't really talk about the impact of oil prices here. But, I would imagine carrier profitability improves maybe cabin the refurb environment picks up a little bit and you guys can see some pick up there?
Tim Romenesko:
Yes. This is Tim, Kevin. We are working off a few contracts that we have now. But we are taking steps to broaden our customer base in engineering services. We have a couple of programs going on in Asia and a few programs in North America. But, as you know they are very lumpy. And the programs that we have today are smaller than the ones that we are working on a year ago. So we are investing in some resources now to be – have more exposure to some of the major reconfigurations – interior reconfiguration programs that are going on. We are seeing some opportunity out of our Lake Charles facility where we can do the touch labor. So hopefully by combining our touch labor capability as well as our engineering services capability bolts in North America and in Asia. We are hoping that we are going to able to cash more business there. But, for the balance of the fiscal year, what we see now is roughly inline with what we had in the first half of the fiscal year.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. Thanks Tim. And then last one for me and I will jump back in queue. Any way you guys can quantify the 47-8, how that rate cut there next year, it sounds like would impact your business?
David Storch:
Well, it definitely has impact on the – at the cargo system and spares level. But, we do have deliveries in the second half of the fiscal year more so than in the first half of the fiscal year. But, the decline in production will over time obviously have an impact. And then also on some spares. One of the variables though is the split, the mix between passenger and freighter.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Right, right.
David Storch:
That it kind of reminds to be seen.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay. Thanks.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Stan Manny [Manny Family Investments].
Stan Manny:
Hi, gentlemen. I have a couple of questions. One, David, on cash flow utilization, can we expect the emphasis on debt pay down or stock buyback?
David Storch:
Both at the right time, right? In this quarter, we reduced some debt and we bought in some shares. So I think we will continue to look at the best utilization for our cash Stan.
Stan Manny:
Okay. And then I have a question that you probably won't answer, but, the equity price is active at normally great in this environment and is there any comments or anything you would be able to say about that?
David Storch:
I believe that the shares are undervalued and represent a wonderful investment opportunity.
Stan Manny:
Okay. That's the question. Okay. Thank you for good job.
David Storch:
Okay. Thank you.
Operator:
And I'm showing no further questions.
David Storch:
Okay. With that, I would like to thank you for your participation today. And I like to wish everybody a very happy and healthy holiday season. All the best.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Again, thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a good day."

Operator:
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the AAR’s Fiscal 2015, First Quarter Earnings Call. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligations to provide updates or reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time I’d like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch :
Thank you, sir, and I’d like to welcome all participants and say I hope you are having a nice day. Thank you for joining us for today’s discussion of our fiscal 2015 first quarter results. We are here in Wood Dale, Illinois. I’m joined by Tim Romenesko, our Chief Operating Officer; John Fortson, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Sharp, our Chief Accounting Officer. Just to share some of the highlights from the quarter, as we indicated sales were down in both of our segments. Sales in our Aviation Service segment were lower, primarily due to the softness in our airlift operations and lower engineering activity in our airframe repair facilities. However, I would like to point out supply chain sales to commercial and defense customers increased about approximately 20% during the period and we had growth in both, to the commercial markets and to the defense markets. We continue to build on our industry leading positions in this business and in addition we had success extending our operations internationally with our new operations in Brussels. In the Technology Product segment, lower sales of mobility products contributed to the sales decline. So consolidated sales, to commercial customers across the board increased by 2.4% and now represent 65% of our total revenue. Consolidated sales to the government defense customers decreased by 24% from the prior year period. But what I’d like to share with you is kind of an overview of how we look at our government defense businesses and we really think of it in three buckets. Bucket one would be fleet sustainment. This would be characterized by supply chain and maintenance activity and in this piece of our defense business we did see growth in the period. New production, we benefited from the increased production of the A400M cargo systems and lastly our businesses tied to the operational tempo that suffered declines and principally that group of defense business is made up of our mobility and airlift businesses and they are tied to the activity, principally in theaters such as Afghanistan and the Middle East. In Aviation Services, sales in the first quarter were down 8% versus prior year and despite the overall lowers sales for the segment, our commercial and defense supply chain operations performed well in the quarter and as mentioned, sales were up 20% and we also saw an improvement in operating margins, an improvement by 300 basis points and as we’ve shared in prior communications, we have an enhanced focus on return on invested capital and in this group of businesses we saw 400 basis point improvement. The business continues to gain momentum with our expanded partnerships, most recently with Eaton and we also have kicked off some of the supply chain programs supporting airlines that we’ve discussed, as well as new government support programs. And as I indicated earlier, our Brussels facility allows us to expand our reach deeper into Europe, Middle East and Africa. Airframe repair this quarter had a tough comparable period due to the sale of an aircraft last year that ran through our maintenance facilities, as well as the slightly slower summer than we had seen in the past. To give you a sense, we had an average about 42, not bad. We have an average of 42 aircrafts in our hangers during the summer and to give you a sense as to the trend, today we have 55 aircrafts in our facilities and are expecting a nice rebound in Q2. As mentioned in our release, we were awarded two new contracts with two major U.S. carriers for narrow and wide body maintenance work to perform at our Lake Charles facility. So our Lake Charles facility, you may recall a year ago we signed the leases. We commenced work roughly less than a year ago and business has been operating at a deficit and we expect with some of the new wins here that that business will start operating profitably here very soon, and if you liken it to our experience with Indianapolis, it took us a good year and a half in Indianapolis before we could start getting a decent return on that facility. As for airlift, the business is down significantly from last year. Last year at this time we had 40 operating positions and you may recall we were experiencing excellent operational performance. This year still experiencing excellent operating performance, however we are down to 19 aircraft positions. We are working hard at transitioning the aircraft that came out of Afghanistan and you may note that we’ve had some recent wins in Africa, both for rotary wing aircraft, as well as fixed wing aircraft. Unfortunately the implementation of these contracts were delayed due to protest by the incumbent, but those protests have since cleared in our favor and the work begins in November 1 for one of the contracts and December 1 for the other contract. We are also bidding. I think we have discussed in the past, we are also bidding on a very large state department contract of this business and we’ll have a sense as to whether we’re successful or not in the January, February timeframe. As for technology products, here sales were down 13%, driven predominately by softer demand for mobility products. You may have caught recently that we’ve formed a cargo group, which includes the acquired Telair and Nordisk businesses with the AAR cargo business. That group has been performing quiet well of late; however, in this period we have a slight reduction in sales due to Boeing’s reduction of 747-8 production line. We do expect cargo systems to ramp as the year progresses and Airbus starts delivery of the A350s. We are the cargo system provider on that aircraft and our content is worth approximately 400,000 per ship and keep in mind, there’s over 750 orders for that aircraft. So if I may at this stage, what I’d like to do is turn the call over to John to fill you in on some of the financial details.
John Fortson:
Thanks David. I trust that each of you have had a chance to read our earnings release. On this call I'd like to review a few key points with regard to our performance. Our consolidated gross profit margin in the first quarter was 16%, down from a 16.5% in the prior year period. This performance translated into a 16.3% margin for Aviation Services and a 15.3% for Technology Products. SG&A as a percentage of sales in the first quarter was 9.6%, slightly higher than the 9.3% in the prior year period. SG&A expense however declined $2.8 million over the prior year period, reflecting continued cost control efforts, but increased slightly as a percentage of sales. Our operating margin for the quarter was 6.6%. Our margins were negatively impacted by the reduced contribution of airlift. During the fourth quarter we generated $15 million of cash from operations and our capital expenditures were $9 million. We paid out $0.075 per share in dividends this quarter as well. We continue to focus on balance sheet management. As you may have seen, we initiated the process to call $30 million of our 1.625% convertible notes due in February. We hope to conclude this exercise in the early part of October.
:
For the first quarter in this fiscal year, our effective tax rate was 32.7% per our guidance in July. We expect this to be the rate for the remainder of the fiscal year and we ended the quarter with 39.2 million shares in the diluted share count. As noted in the earnings press release, we are also revising our earnings guidance. Our previous earnings guidance included assumptions on a number and mix of contracted airlift positions that have yet to materialize due to the political uncertainty in Afghanistan. Therefore we are lowering our earnings per share guidance from a range of $1.80 to $1.90 to a range of $1.65 to $1.75, and our sales guidance from a range of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion to a range of $2 billion to $2.05 billion. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back over to David.
David Storch:
Thanks John. Just in summary, we tried to capture it in the earnings release as well, is that you know our supply chain businesses are performing very well. MRO had a tough Q1, but we expect recovery in Q2 through Q4. As a matter of fact we are looking for improvement on a year-over-year basis for those businesses. One of the things I’d like to stress in supply chain is, we do see strength both from the commercial and defense side of that business and in total we see those businesses as I said, performing quite well. Unfortunately the drop off in business in airlift has come as a faster clip than we had hoped for. I still have a high level of confidence in the team we have in place and the opportunity pool that we are looking at for that business. But we are at this stage, based on what we know, and you may recall in the past we’ve announced a contract award that was refereed to as NATO 18. Although we’re the successful contract winner, we have yet to receive any task orders and as we sit here today we have a high enough level of uncertainty that we’ve chosen to reduce our forecast for this type of activity. So I think it’s a prudent thing to do at this stage. We still feel very good about our businesses and our position. We still maintain leadership positions in everything that we do and we’ll continue to stay very focused on taking market share, generating cash and giving a good account for ourselves and a good return to our share holders. We also continue looking at underperforming businesses. We still have a couple of those and as I committed at the last conference call, we will have action against those businesses before the fiscal year is out. So with that, what I’d like to do is open up the call for any questions that you may have at this stage.
Operator:
(Operator Instructions). First question is from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
Hi, good afternoon David. Could you maybe just discuss just a little bit on airlift and then mobility. Airlift, everything actually you say is qualitatively in line. It sounds like commercial is humming along as you expected and improving. I think that the one question I have is, does airlift – could it stay at these levels or even go lower. Does that take a couple of years to play itself out and then on mobility, has that taken another a little bit of a lag down or is it sort of just balancing on the bottom?
David Storch:
Yes, so the airlift has probably taken a little bit further move down, not meaningfully as it has say last year over the prior year, but it continues to be challenged as it relates to airlift. It’s a little unpredictable at this stage, because we are responding to a fair amount of our Qs and I still remain relatively optimistic that we can have nice successful performance coming out of the business. But keep in mind Larry, last year this quarter and last year the performance was exceptional and we would need more positions to go. We’d have to get a tremendous increase in usage to approximate last year’s performance. So we are not counting on last year’s performance to be duplicated, but we do see in the - we see next quarter also or the quarter that we are currently in being a little tough, because the actual positions, we were hopeful we were awarded those in the last fiscal year. We were hopeful that that work would have kicked in in Q1; it didn’t because of the protest. As I indicated the protest has been cleared, but the work doesn’t begin until November 1 on one of the contracts and December on the other contract. So as we sit here planning right now, we are thinking Q2 is kind of the trough period and that we start seeing an uptick in Q3 and Q4.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
And my concern actually is I realize that the near term is, with these just placed on, it’s not easy to – with delays as well. Just as you look out two, three years you mentioned the state department contract, which I imagine is – I don’t know if you can help us on size with that one, but are you bidding. I know that there are other opportunities that you discussed in the past more globally, but are you attempting to get into those areas as Afghanistan. Even best case you will still have several aircraft to utilize.
David Storch:
Yes, so we see opportunity. We see the Africa market expanding, so we see opportunities there. We see more opportunities around supporting the navy and we will be deploying some assets for additional navy contracts here shortly. So yes, I think we see a nice pool of opportunities. Of course, you know we’ve had a fair amount of aircraft come back at us. So some that we didn’t expect and some that we did expect, but yes, I think the team is looking at quite a few opportunities. The state department opportunity is very sizable and hopefully we’ll give a good accounting for ourselves in this bidding process. But you know of course on that one it’s the winner takes it all. You either win it or you don’t and if we win it its pretty and if you don’t win it, it’s not.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
Right, I guess that’s why I guess you got to try multiple shots on goal. I guess some of them hopefully reach the net.
David Storch:
That’s exactly right. So we are out there, the guys are slugging away. Just to be clear, still a profitable business and still making nice contributions, just not the levels it has in the past and it’s hard to for us to make up for the dip across our businesses, although we did to some extent.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
Right, and just one quickly if I may. Just on the expanded Eaton deal, you said it should ramp within about a year. So it actually seems pretty fast. Is this deal similar in size to the one you did on the defense side with them? Is it a similar type arrangement and how is that ramping?
David Storch:
Yes, it’s a smaller transaction. It’s a different customer base, but it’s a nice piece of business. It leverages our relationships there and it will ramp here fairly quickly.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
Got you, great. Thanks.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question is from Tyler Hojo of Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company:
Yes, hi. Good evening everyone.
David Storch:
Hi Tyler.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company:
Hi. So just going back to Airlift for a second, could you help us a little bit in terms of sizing that business today in terms of revenues? And I’m also kind of kind of curious; I guess we’ve got 19 positions today. What is the expectation for guidance? Is it that 19 positions remains stable or does it go up or down from there.
David Storch:
So we are thinking that the low point is this quarter in the 19 range. We may come off a couple here in November and then we replace with others elsewhere. So we have a few more coming back from Afghanistan, but then we have a few going out to Africa, but we are expecting by Q3 to be at 23 aircraft.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company:
23 aircrafts, okay, great. And then just as kind of this airlift relates to the overall business, I think historically speaking Q1 has been your weakest quarter, but with this airlift dynamic, is Q2 expected to be down sequentially in terms of earnings?
David Storch:
No, we are looking at the Q2 being relatively flat with Q1 is how we are seeing it.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company:
Okay, great. And maybe just transitioning over to MRO, certainly nice to hear about the progress at St. Charles. Maybe David you could provide a little bit of commentary as to kind of where utilization is with the wins and where utilization needs to be or needs to go to in order to kind of make some of those ROIC bogies that you’ve set for yourself.
David Storch:
So as we are sitting here today, we are strong in Oklahoma, Duluth, Miami and Indianapolis. We have a room for improvement at Lake Charles and in Hot Springs.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company:
Okay, and in terms of timing on Lake Charles. Did these wins kind of get you to where you want to be or do you need to kind of win some more to kind of fill it to a more steady state level.
David Storch:
Yes, Tim maybe you can answer that.
Tim Romenesko:
So Lake Charles is in good shape in terms of our outlook and our commitments from our customers. What we are doing there is some of the work that we are doing now is lighter hours as we kind of get our [burn in] [ph] set and then as we go into the second half of the fiscal year with additional aircraft that come on with heavier manpower utilization, then we’ll see that ramp up more significantly. But in terms of actual iron in the facility, we are in good shape. It’s just that the hours that we are working on them now are light compared to some of the other facilities.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company:
Yes, that’s great to hear. Actually just one follow-up going back to airlift, how many aircrafts are currently available for sale there and I guess I’m just kind of curious on your perspective in regards to how those assets are being received in the market place? Are they desirable aircraft or are you getting pushed back?
David Storch:
So there are 15 aircraft that we have determined are for sale. Those aircrafts are for the most part fairly niche oriented aircraft. So it’s the type of asset that if you have the right asset when somebody needs it, it’s very valuable and we’ve had a series of discussions with perspective customers. We’ve got to do a better job on remarketing. The team has been very focused on repositioning aircraft into different theaters, but we are in the process of trying to onboard a individual to go ahead and have his exclusive responsibility to remarketing of these aircrafts. We don’t have that person onboard right now. Right now we are handling it through our – actually through our purchasing department down there. We don’t have a aircraft sales department, but as a result of the build up of inventory, we will be focused on that.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company:
All right great. That’s all I had, that’s a lot gentlemen.
David Storch:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question is from Julie Yates, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Krishna Vege - Credit Suisse:
Hey guys, this is Krishna Vege filling in for Julie. Just wanted to ask, it seems free cash flow to net income conversion was light this quarter compared to the last couple of 1Q’s. Just was wondering, what are some of the puts and takes on this and how does this compare with where you’d like it to be. Thanks.
David Storch:
So you might note that also we commented that we made investments in our supply chain businesses. So we have net increase of invested capital, even though our return on capital was up 400 basis points. We have a net increase of invested capital there of approximately $25 million. So yes, we are looking invest if you will in the growth of those business. So there is a little pressure short term here on cash, but I think we are investing it wisely.
Krishna Vege - Credit Suisse:
Okay, thank you.
David Storch:
You’re welcome.
Operator:
The next question is from J.B. Groh of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
J.B. Groh - D.A. Davidson:
Yes, hey guys. I just wanted to follow up on Tyler question. I didn’t hear you really kind of size that airlift business from the old segmentation to kind of the new segmentation. Can you give us a little help there?
David Storch:
No, we’ve never really sized that business precisely. So I don’t think its in our public information. So I think the way that we’ve been sizing it is really around the number of positions we may change. We may decide to do that differently, but for now at least J.B. we are sizing it by the number of aircrafts.
J.B. Groh - D.A. Davidson:
Okay, that’s fair enough. And then just a question on, you’ve been…
David Storch:
And J.B. just to be clear, that’s for comparative purposes. We know right now and we have a leadership position and we are not looking to educate our competitors.
J.B. Groh - D.A. Davidson:
Yes, completely understand. Just on the new deals that you’ve won and the small acquisition, how much of that is in the guidance. I mean in terms of the new deals, when do they start to contribute on the MRO side.
David Storch:
Well, we should start seeing contribution this quarter.
J.B. Groh - D.A. Davidson:
Okay. So that’s baked into the guidance, the update guidance.
David Storch:
Yes, that’s correct.
J.B. Groh - D.A. Davidson:
Okay. Thank you.
David Storch:
Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you (Operator Instructions). The next question is from Kevin Ciabattoni, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets :
Thanks. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question here.
David Storch:
Sure.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets :
Just one housekeeping on airlift. I think last quarter you mentioned 28 positions by the end of the year. Just kind of wondering where that stands now. I know you mentioned 23 by the end of 3Q.
John Fortson:
Yes. So hey Kevin, its John. I mean look, there were a number of aircraft positions tied to some contracts that we thought we were going to get awarded and we had a high level of confidence, but over the last 30 to 45 days the situation has deteriorated and we no longer think that those contracts are going to materialize, right. So ultimately what we are loosing, nine slots to that, but then we are picking up an incremental four, right.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets :
Okay.
David Storch:
Well yes, just to clarify, we did win those contracts, but we just haven’t received any task orders.
John Fortson:
Right.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets :
Okay. So I mean assuming that the NATO 18 contract largely, it seems like the power sharing agreements been singed there. Do you guys have any visibility into kind of when you are thinking the security agreement might get signed; maybe kick off some of those task orders.
David Storch:
Yes, unfortunately we do not. You have as much visibility as we do at this point. We tried to gain some of that yesterday in preparation for the release, but we were not successful. So we were hopeful that the love in there would create some opportunities for us, but it hasn’t trickled down to us yet.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets :
Okay, that’s helpful. And then shifting over to kind of the commercial side, could you maybe walk us through the process you went through looking at building the new facility and kind of what we can expect there in terms of CapEx contribution from you guys between now and when that…?
David Storch:
So when we looked at the global market and zeroed in on the U.S. market, we see a need for maintenance hangers that are capable of managing these new generation aircrafts, where the tails are a little bit higher and the wings are a little bit longer and there aren’t many facilities in North America capable of handling these aircrafts. The State of Illinois was very helpful in allocating funds to build a state of the art that would accommodate these new generation aircrafts and they put together a very attractive package for us and we’ll probably start commence building in about six months. It will probably take 18 months from there. So by that stage, some of these aircrafts, the 777X and the 787 will be getting to the point were they’ll be entering the maintenance cycle and we should be in a good position to capture some of that work and the facility will go a long way towards helping. Now, in addition to the maintenance facilities that they are building, they are also building a mechanics training facility next door. So we are hopeful that they will be graduating somewhere between a 100 and 150 machines a year that would provide us with a wealth of trained folks to work on these aircrafts.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets :
Yes, I know that’s been a headwind for you guys in a past, on new talent, so that’s promising.
David Storch:
I give the State of Illinois credit, not really thought of as a business friendly environment. In this case I think they thought this through very intelligently in terms of kind of combining the training with the facilities with selecting what they consider to be the best MRO provider in the North America and going ahead and pulling the trigger and putting the capital behind this idea.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets :
Okay, thanks. And then just turning to Europe quick, maybe if you have any color you can give us on what type of opportunities you are seeing there via the Brussels operation? It sounds like its going well. Was just kind of curious as to what – maybe if you can give some more specifics.
David Storch:
Yes, so we are touching customers that we haven’t touched in the past. So clearly we are in addition to providing them the contracted services that they’ve already agreed to with the predecessor entity, we are seeing opportunities to provide other products and services to these customers. So we are fairly optimistic that we can get us a fair share of business from that market, see some growth, take some of the activities deeper into the Middle East where you are seeing growth particularly in new generation aircrafts without the infrastructure lets say, and then the African market, we are looking on that fairly positively as well. So we have a fair level of dialog in all three markets and are relatively encouraged with near term, mid-term and longer term opportunities.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets :
Great, thank you. I’ll jump back in queue.
David Storch:
Okay. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. We have no future questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.
David Storch:
Well, thank you for your participation today and I wish everybody a good day and look forward to chatting with everybody in December when we release second quarter results. Thank you.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."

Operator:
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and yearned earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the comments made during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and our Risk Factor section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David Storch:
Hi, thank you very much, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 yearend results. We will also provide some guidance and expectations for our fiscal year 2015 with a little color. And I'm here in suburbs of Chicago, joined by Tim Romenesko, our Chief Operating Officer; John Fortson, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Sharp, our Chief Accounting Officer and Controller. Just to reiterate some of the highlights from the quarter. Sales were $505 million, although down from prior year, up from prior quarter. Sales in the Aviation Service segment were lower, primarily due to the softness in MRO and airlift, so we had fewer positions in the airlift operation, and MRO just went through some seasonality issues with certain customers. We haven't lost that business, just less demand during the period. Our supply chain business had a lot of momentum, had a good quarter, and goes into the new year with a strong backlog and a lot of exciting things going on. Technology Products, we had softer commercial sales largely due to fewer 747-8 systems, but we did experience defense growth with A400M system sales. Our operating income in the quarter was $33 million. Net earnings for the quarter were $0.43, which was higher than the latest consensus and higher than what we reported for fiscal year 2013 or the prior year's quarter. For the full year, sales were $2.04 billion, which would be a decrease of just under 5% for the year. Operating income was $146 million with slightly better margin, [7.2%] than prior-year performance. We reported diluted earnings per share of $1.83, ahead of the $1.81 consensus expectation, and this compares to the $1.38 reported for fiscal year 2013. As we look back at the year, it is important to point out that we also generated significant cash flow, so we had cash flow from operations of $140 million and free cash flow of $113 million, which equates to the $2.90 per share. With that cash, we paid some dividends and we further reduced our net debt position. I should add that we made significant investments. Net of that, we made significant investments supporting the growth in our supply chain businesses. As I move over to Aviation Services, in our fourth quarter, sales were down 10% versus prior year. Supply chain had strong performance, starting to see the benefits of investments we made throughout the year and the positive impact on new programs. Today, we are fully operational on our supply chain hub in Brussels, and we continue to expand our reach across the series of new clients. We expect meaningful growth from these programs with supply chain having won an aggregate value of $1.9 billion of new contracts during the fiscal year that will be realized over the life of the program. Some of the programs are five years in duration, some are 10, some are 12, but clearly this is a newer trend for the company. Historically, our supply chain businesses had a shorter window. Today, we're signing not just shorter deals, but also more longer deals in our effort to become more integral to our customers’ operations. In MRO, sales for the quarter were down, driven primarily by cyclical downturn in our landing gear business, and wind down of meaningful engineering service contracts. You might recall that engineering service business, where we have a crackerjack team and capability in place is very deal-sensitive. So, if we get a deal, it's great business. When you don't get a deal, it's not as good. But when we do comparatives on a year-over-year basis, last year we had a very appealing deal with North American carrier, and this year we didn't have that business. So those guys are knocking on doors, and I'm sure they'll have successes to report during this current fiscal year. To counter some of the headwinds that we have experienced, we've refocused our MRO leadership to exploit the advantages of our one MRO strategy, and to aggressively pursue business opportunities with new customers and for wide-body airframes. We're proud to complete our first 777 work, which we performed on behalf of Aeromexico, who we also did 767 work for as well. So, although sales were down in the period, we have taken steps to improve that performance, and I think as this year unfolds, when you look at the back half of the year, we're fully sold-out in our MRO shop, and we do expect the turnarounds in our landing gear operation as the gear repair cycle kicks in. Airlift continues to transition new opportunities as we discussed at the beginning of fiscal year 2014 with 40 flying aircraft positions. We ended the year with 20, which was three lower than we guided last quarter. Airlift did a good job reducing costs and finding efficiencies throughout the year to reflect this new environment and came in with excellent operating margins. For fiscal year 2015, we anticipate the positions will trough in Q1, and that's where we got down to 17 in June, but will increase its previously awarded positions to come on line. We expect to finish the year with 28 positions operating. Let me now turn to Technology Products. Sales in this segment were down 4%, driven primarily by softer demand for the commercial cargo products. Mobility products actually had a strong quarter and performed better than last year, with higher sales for the quarter than prior-year period. However, commercial cargo had lower sales than expected due to reduced 747-8 cargo systems demand from Boeing and lower spare sales. Going into fiscal year 2015, we expect commercial cargo to transition, to increase production as the A320 and the A350s ramp. So, we are exclusive on both of those models. We will also be a beneficiary of the A330, where we sell systems between $350,000 and $450,000 per shipset. And as many of you saw on Monday, Airbus announced their intentions to create an A330neo, which will keep that aircraft operating or on the production line for at least another 10 years. In closing, as we move into our new fiscal year, we will continue to focus on execution, finding growth opportunities, improving our performance and margins, while delivering higher levels of cash generation. So let me do this at this moment. Let me turn the call over to John, who will fill you in on some of the financials, and then will circle back to me for closing comments.
John Fortson:
Thanks David. I trust that each of you had a chance to read our earnings release, which was posted yesterday afternoon. On this call, I'd like to review a few key points with regards to our performance. We improved our consolidated gross profit margin in the fourth quarter to 17% from the adjusted 16.3% in the prior-year period. This performance translated into a 16.8% margin for Aviation Services and a 17.6% margin for Technology Products. SG&A as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter was 10.5%. This is higher than last few quarters due to higher compensation expenses this quarter. I would like to note that we expect in FY '15 for these margins to improve on a year-on-year basis going forward, as our cost control initiatives continue. Our operating margin for the year was 7.2%. During the fourth quarter, we generated $63.1 million in cash from operations and our capital expenditures were $5.3 million. We are very focused on receivables management and cash collection. We continue to delever and reduce our net indebtedness by further $89 million from the prior year, ending the year with total debt of $634 million and net debt of $545 million. Our net debt-to-EBITDA is currently at 2.3x, down from 2.6x a year ago and 3.2x at the end of fiscal year '12. This is within the range we have set ourselves as a target of 2x to 2.5x. Net interest expense for the fourth quarter declined to $9.1 million. Our net interest expense numbers continue to decline, as we focus on paying down debt. Depreciation and amortization, including amortization stock-based compensation, was $23.6 million during the fourth quarter. For fiscal year 2014, our effective tax rate was 30.5%. For fiscal year 2015, we are anticipating this rate to be 32.7%. This is a change from the 34.5% we historically guided people to for planning purposes and reflect increased utilization of tax credits. We are analyzing our tax position carefully, and after reviewing our tax obligations over the last five years, we feel comfortable in guiding to this rate of 32.7%. We enter fiscal 2015 with 39.1 million shares in the diluted share count. David discussed our anticipated schedule of aircraft positions over the next year in airlift, but I would also note that we now have 12 aircraft available for sale, which is up from nine at the end of last quarter with a combined book value of over $33 million. We continue to analyze the portfolio and may consider adding more aircraft to this list, if the situation warrants. Our after-tax ROIC for the year was 6.1%. In fiscal year 2015, we are adjusting management's compensation plan to include ROIC as a performance metric in the company's long-term incentive plan. ROIC is being used by our business units to mange their businesses for a long time. We believe it is an important return metric that we can use a corporate to drive performance and we'll be monitoring it closely going forward and seeking to improvement. There are a few businesses that have been a drag on this corporate rate and we are now dedicating effort to improve these, as we have finished our deleveraging. Thank you for your attention. And I will now turn the call back over to David for some closing comments.
David Storch:
Let me just add a little bit to that. As John has alluded, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has come down from a peak of 3.2x down to 2.3x. Another way of looking at it, we had actually peaked net debt at about $805 million after we closed on Telair and Nordisk acquisitions, and today we're at net debt of $545 million. So we've had meaningful reductions. In the two fiscal years, we've gone from $750 million-ish to $545 million. So we've taken $200 million of debt or capital off the business. So we're very pleased with that. And we think we put ourselves into an appealing leverage ratio, which now causes us to look at things and focus on those businesses that are performing and those businesses that are underperforming. We've had a couple of underperforming businesses, which have been a drag on our return calculations. And I just want to state that before this year is out, we will take actions with these businesses that will lead to a positive impact on how we give returns on the capital that you've entrusted us with to manage on your behalf. So let me move on and conclude with our guidance for fiscal year 2015. As stated in our press release, we currently expect sales in the range of $2.100 billion to $2.150 billion. Aviation Services, we expect to see strong growth in our supply chain business and improve our opportunities in MRO. We also except the airlift to have some puts and takes, as it evolves, both losing some existing positions, but gaining others. And you please have comfort in knowing that we've had very appealing, very attractive returns from this business, and this business has been a very positive cash generator for the company. In our Technology Product business, we do expect the ramp of shipments on the A400M, cargo loading system and improvement in commercial cargo, as a result of A320 and A350 deliveries. And our mobility business will continue to experience some softness, as military budgets remain under pressure. And taking a look around the world and looking at so many unsettling situations, we won't be surprised that at some point the mobility business gets a call to action and sees an up tick in its activity. I should also just comment on the fact that this business is still a leader, has a leadership position in its market niche, and we've seen operating income in that business that has been the $75 million range. Today we're operating in the $20 million range. So you can see we've had a significant fall-off in demand, but we still maintain a leadership position in that market in exclusive on many of the products that we do deliver for the DoD. We anticipate full year diluted earnings per share in the $1.80 to $1.90 range. And our customer schedule for heavy maintenance business is light during the first quarter, but increases significantly in the second half of the fiscal year to the point where most of our facilities are sold-out for the second half of the year. Because of this and the positioning schedule, our aircraft portfolio, we do anticipate the first quarter will be a little softer than other quarters of this year. And we always like to stay away from hockey stick approaches, but the reality is we do have some seasonality to our businesses and this is how we look to the businesses unfolding for the year. In closing, I would want to reiterate the strengths and the performance of the company during the year in terms of the cash flow generation, and I would encourage investors to look at this indicator as a sign of strength coming from the company. So with that, I'll close my comments and open up the phones for any questions you might have.

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
Just a few questions. We've spoken a lot about the ramping of several contracts in the supply chain. Perhaps you could just sort of review where we stand, some of the major ones, I guess, Unison, is that fully ramped? And how is the Eaton deal going? And then also probably, just new consumable parts contract that you announced last quarter?
Timothy Romenesko:
So yes, the consumable program is still ramping. We're working aggressively to setup a new distribution center in Indianapolis to support that program. So, it will probably take us a few more months, I would say, to get the full ramp. The Unison transaction is going as we had anticipated in accordance with our schedule. And then on Eaton, we're continuing to ramp that program, and we see additional opportunities to grow that product line. We've had a tremendous amount of success in this piece of our business. We're digesting some of the volumes, but we see significant new opportunities here.
David Storch:
Larry, let me add also that the investments that we've made in the Brussels operation is leading to deals flow coming out of European customers and Middle East customers that we have not seen before. So, the team is aggressively pursuing that market in a way that we didn't really have the capability or visibility in the past.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
And then on the airlift business, the projection for 28 aircraft being utilized at yearend, does that assume most are out of Afghanistan except for the -- I guess, there are some from this new contract you announced last year. And I realized there's some uncertainties, but are you assuming or is this 28 based on sort of ongoing discussions or what you sort of have believed to be in-hand today or do you assume that you'll get new contracts?
John Fortson:
These assumptions are based on our contract positions in Afghanistan as well as previously announced contract positions both in Afghanistan for NATO, but also incremental positions in Africa that we've already been awarded, Larry. Of the 28, four are what I would call sort of new business, right. The rest are already awarded positions that we're expecting the contracts to get turned on.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
And then just calling on David's comment about some of the underperforming businesses, can we expect a potential sale of some of these things to improve? Are you expecting – are there initiatives out there that you expect to sort of improve operations which will help returns?
David Storch:
Larry, let me just say that by the end of the year that we will have these -- our intention is to have these problems solved.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
On cash flow, another fabulous year in terms of cash flow. Is that a sustainable number? What's the outlook for that in '15?
David Storch:
So, we're looking at directionally in a similar way as we experienced last couple of years, but we do anticipate some investments in the supply chain business, which might not allow us to hit quite the same level as we had this year, but we expect it to be strong.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.
Unidentified Analyst:
This is actually [ph] Krishna, her associate. Julie is on a flight right now. But just wanted to ask, if you could give a bit more color on your '15 guidance, I was just wondering where do you guys see some potential for upside to that and potentially even where do you guys see some risks?
David Storch:
So yes, I think we see potential for upside in the supply chain. We've been putting pressure on the supply chain group to grow its earnings at a faster clip than they submitted, let's say, and the deal flow seems to be pretty robust. We are not calculating in any significant deals in that number. So, if we do have a deal or two which -- and they are out there that would have a positive impact on our results.
Operator:
The next question comes from Kevin Ciabattoni with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Kevin Ciabattoni :
Looking at the guidance for '15, just wondering if you could give us some color on maybe some of the margin headwind versus '14, is that just a matter of mix with airlift positions coming out? Any color you could give there would help?
KeyBanc Capital Markets:
Looking at the guidance for '15, just wondering if you could give us some color on maybe some of the margin headwind versus '14, is that just a matter of mix with airlift positions coming out? Any color you could give there would help?
John Fortson:
Kevin, that's an accurate read. I mean I think really you've got -- we do have a sales and a margin mix shift going on a little bit, and so as airlift comes down, obviously that puts some downward pressure, and as the supply chain businesses sort of kick in, they have to kind of continue to produce volume to get the margins kind of back up. So that's kind of what's happening there.
Kevin Ciabattoni :
And then, just following up on Larry's airlift question, can you, John, maybe tell us how many positions do you have baked in for that NATO 18 contract? And then also what you guys have baked in in terms of the asset sales for next year?
KeyBanc Capital Markets:
And then, just following up on Larry's airlift question, can you, John, maybe tell us how many positions do you have baked in for that NATO 18 contract? And then also what you guys have baked in in terms of the asset sales for next year?
John Fortson:
So we have four NATO positions that we've been awarded. We're just waiting for the go-ahead, and I think part of that is waiting on the services agreement to be signed between the countries. In terms of baked into the plans for sales, I think we have a few, but not the full complement of aircrafts that are for sale.
Kevin Ciabattoni :
Last one from me. Last couple of quarters, you guys have given the billable hours in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could give us that for 4Q and maybe that comp for last year?
KeyBanc Capital Markets:
Last one from me. Last couple of quarters, you guys have given the billable hours in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could give us that for 4Q and maybe that comp for last year?
John Fortson:
Yes, just hang on a sec here. I got so many pages in front of me. So, our billable hours over the last 12 months, we sold over 5 million, 5.035 million hours of work sold, right. That's a production efficiency of a 107%. We worked on 1,082 aircrafts.
Kevin Ciabattoni :
Do you have the fourth quarter number, if any John?
KeyBanc Capital Markets:
Do you have the fourth quarter number, if any John?
John Fortson:
Fourth quarter, we sold 1,218,000. The production efficiency just so you know is 111%, so it was good.
Operator:
Our next question comes from J.B. Groh with D.A. Davidson.
Alex Heinen - D.A. Davidson:
This is Alex Heinen on for J.B. today. So just a follow-up question on the MRO business here, you know you said that you were seeing a bit of cyclical downturn in the landing gear business and maybe some seasonality kind of washed into this quarter. Do you expect that to kind of go away starting in Q1 or should we see maybe a slow ramp backup from the space going forward?
Timothy Romenesko:
So we see the summer is actually the toughest month in the hangers. All of the operators want to have their fleet deployed as much as they possibly can. So we see that the aircraft starting to come back into the hangers' kind of mid-second quarter and then ramping up through the balance of the fiscal year. Also in the September, October timeframe we have access to an additional hanger in Lake Charles. We have some good customer interest in that. So that also contributes to kind of our optimism for the second half of the fiscal year. And we are training our workforce now in anticipation of some of the work that we have scheduled for Lake Charles. And so we are optimistic that it's going to turn into a successful operation.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Stan Manne with Manne Family Investments.
Stan Manne - Manne Family Investments:
A prime question I have is on your expectations for use of cash in 2015. You did mentioned debt reduction, but what about M&A possibilities?
David Storch:
Yes. So the M&A pipeline is fairly robust for us at this stage. We do feel pretty good about our ratios and financial position today. So we may be looking for ways to strengthen our supply chain business during the upcoming period.
Stan Manne - Manne Family Investments:
But you do have opportunities or targets that exists?
David Storch:
We do.
Stan Manne - Manne Family Investments:
You mentioned, kind of obliquely, the possible sale of any of your businesses, is that something?
David Storch:
Let's stand to be more precise, so I have indicated is that we had certain underperforming business that we will solve this fiscal year.
Stan Manne - Manne Family Investments:
So that means you possibly could have operating margin improvement?
David Storch:
Yes.
Operator:
Our next question is a follow-up question from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
Just a couple of quickies on the trading, the parts business, what's the recent trends, pricing been in that piece?
David Storch:
I would say, fairly consistent with historical pricing. It's steady and it's been pretty decent for us. We are seeing our returns improved in that business and we anticipate our returns will continue to improve in that business. The market is fairly bullish. It's a fairly positive market environment for that business today.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
Right.
David Storch:
I think we have done some smart things in positioning the company in a more international way.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
And then you touched on the Lake Charles. I think it's just starting to ramp, and I guess part of the increased focus is on the wide-body, is that supported by Lake Charles?
Timothy Romenesko:
Yes, Larry, it's Tim. Yes, it is. That would be kind of our main wide-body operation. We have a couple of aircraft in there now. But we do expect the Lake Charles facility to be busy as we get into the second half of the fiscal year.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
And you expect that to be profitable this year for the full year?
Timothy Romenesko:
We do.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
Great.
Timothy Romenesko:
We do. But we also do wide-body in other places in our network, but Lake Charles will be well-suited for it.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
And then just last one, on the tax rate. I like the position there with the 32.7%. Is that ballpark, is that lower number, maybe not exactly that, but is that a sustainable number going forward or do you have something?
Timothy Romenesko:
We went back, Larry, and we actually went back more than five years, but if you look back over the last five years, we feel that that's a comfortable rate that we sort of have achieved year-on-year. I mean, when you look specifically at what we're looking at for next year, it kind of triangulates in.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
And then, but going out in the out years, is it hard to say?
Timothy Romenesko:
I think, if history is any indictor, we think that's a good number.
Operator:
And I am not showing any further questions at this time.
David Storch:
Well, thank you for your participation today. And hopefully everybody has a nice day and including our share price. And I just want to leave everybody with the impression that the company, we are working hard to increase value and very focused on executing and delivering value to everybody. So thank you for your participation.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day."

March 20, 2014
Operator:
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to AAR’s Fiscal 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David P. Storch:
Thank you, sir and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2014 performance. With me in Chicago are Tim Romenesko and John Fortson and few other senior folks here at the company. On today’s call I would like to start by discussing our third quarter results and then providing with an explanation about actions we are taking to counter the revenue decline we experience and how we are positioning our company for future growth. Let me begin with Aviation Services; in the Aviation Services segment, sales were down 10% from last year to $368 million as mentioned in our press release our MRO operations had difficult quarter, sales were down $24.3 million in that sub-segment within our Aviation Services Group. Sales in the airframe maintenance facility were lower by approximately $5 million as we conclude several large 757 maintenance programs. In this call, I will give you a sense of our billable hours of 1.1 million as opposed to 1.3 million in the prior year. Sales in our engineering services unit where we completed a sizeable engineering service program were down by $10 million. We have engineering service work, but not of the same size or stock as we had last year with the program we completed and you may recall that this is the business from time-to-time we win contracts and there are times where we have a low-end activity. Our Landing Gear and Component Repair revenues were down $9.4 million due to the repair cycle declined for Landing Gear and just lower input from component. That address the weakness in MRO activity in this quadrant position of the business for the future, we have narrowed the focus of our leadership team to try to improve performance. In this regard, we had Dany Kleiman who runs MRO performing other functions of the company, we’ve moved in back to MRO only and put a little bit more sales emphasis around him, so that we can recapture some business. Now we are actively pursuing entry into E-Jet after- market support. We believe that the aircraft is selling well in the United States and we line up well. It’s a good fit for the company. We have the airframe, landing gear and component, repair capability we’ve good enough product knowledge. As you can see from one of the awards that we announced, we’ve had some success supporting that platform. We also plan to expand our world-class landing gear repair and overall capability into ancillary product line including actuation, wheels, and brakes. We have discussed before the landing gear repair cycles about 10 year cycle, we’re still suffering from the lack of new aircraft sales into the market back in the 2003, 2004 time period. But as you recall, the markets got little bit firmer in the 2004, 2005 or 2006 time period which should bode well again for our landing gear business. We have not lost any contracts. We have one contract. The existing customer base requirement is softer today than it would at another point in time in that repair cycle. In our commercial supply chain operations sales were down by 2% as we restructured a current and existing contract. This was a Time and Material contract that we shifted over to Power-by-the-Hour. Although the sales from that program are down as sales, the income contribution from that program is relatively flat. So you have roughly $10 million to $12 million less to sales but roughly the same earning contribution. We do believe that this business had been somewhat negatively impacted by weather conditions in the period. We didn’t talk about that really in the earnings release and we have fundamental because it’s very hard for us to quantify but in the two months in January and February they were 74,500 flights that were canceled, and of course the parts business is tied very much to take off the landing and of course the year aligned cash flows impacted in a way that they can defer certain maintenance events and they can defer certain acquisitions of inventory as we see in the past. They’ll do so and just to give you a sense of the change in parts business on a sequential basis, our revenues were down $7 million from second quarter in our commercial parts business. Now the temporary step back that we’d experienced, we believe we counterbalance by strong momentum and a signing new contracts as indicated in the earning release. During last quarter-end, we announced several new distribution supply agreements with blue-chip customers. And I’ll try and provide a little additional color for why these contracts are important for the company that you would not have seen in the earnings release. And so if you look at the Sabena acquisition, it puts a supply chain group in the position offer true notable inventory pooling support to customers in the European Middle East and Africa region. And I’d say a true global inventory pooling. Our inventory management programs today have been more designed around individual customers and providing inventory to that customer. This will be our first venture if you will into pooling where the inventory is available for multiple aircraft operate flying the same platform. This business is currently headquartered in Brussels and will continue to be headquartered in Brussels. We’ve opened up a new warehouse and will be operational on this business on or about April 1. And we believe it will give us the size, the scope and the scale and the infrastructure that will allow us to compete effectively in these markets and these markets are dominated by Lufthansa, Air France and some of the other major airline players. We’re hoping that by independent provider that that will be a point of differentiation that will allow us to capture more business and grow this particular piece of our business. We’ve talked about this U.S. airline win. It’s been requested that we will not disclose the name of the airline, but this new line of business for this supply chain group is offering consumable and expandable support and we believe by doing this successfully for this airline that there will be other airlines who will expect interest which has actually been the case, but since we’ve announced this agreement, we’ve received multiple requested design expandable support programs for other customers in North America and in Asia. The Eaton win builds on a success with Unison and establishes AAR as the clear alternative for OEM as they look to access more diversified channels to market. So AAR’s access to the matter [ph] is Power-by-the-Hour agreements, MRO network and expendable support offering to get OEMs excited and gets them closer to the point of demand. As they look to streamline their marketing initiative in the case of Eaton and in the case of Unison, they decide to reduce the number of vendors that they’ve worked with and they choose AAR as a preferred distribution source for their products. Our strategic initiatives with OEMs, I’ll name a few; Honeywell, Thales, Liebherr Rockwell, Technofan, allowing us where they stand behind us and they are powered by our agreements allow us to we believe, it gives us a what we consider to be a superior option to the airline, large airline MRO powered by our support offering and we’ve had some success in some of the programs we have talked about before by doing this. And we have ramped up our efforts to capture foreign military sales opportunities in terms of programs and material distribution, particularly given the slowdown in U.S. defense spending and we should have some wins that we can announce shortly. As far our airlines business, as expected, sales were down and in period they were down $13 million. Since our last call in December, we have the following updates that these scoping at a rotary-wing position for the contract that expired on November 30 has proceed as plan and we are expecting to remain free contract positions to be completed by the end of April. We are currently not flying any aircraft under the new USAFRICOM contract due to a protest that was filed by the incumbent operator and we are expecting decision coming out of JAO shortly and hopefully we will be able to begin work on that contract soon. No task force have been received to date for the new NATO 18 contract announced in December and you might recall that we have four aircrafts that we have more or less designated for that contract. We are in the process of streamlining our fleet as we’ve discussed before reducing the number of aircraft types that we offer the market. In that regard we’ll be selling off nine different aircrafts that will no longer be required for our long range plan for this business. So from today’s perspective, we think to end our fiscal 2014 with its haul of 23 aircraft positions, this is a difference from the previously communicated number of 29 which we mentioned in our December call and purely relates to the four delayed NATO Allies [ph] past quarters and the delayed ramp-up in Africa associated with that protest where we were the winning bidder and we are just waiting for the protest to clear and well hoping to clear as favorably – clear in our favor. I should continue by saying that we do see good prospects for our Airlift Services globally. We are actively engaged on diversifying operations away from Afghanistan and managing through expense of proposal on the bid activity, more specifically we are pursuing SOCOM [ph] and AFRICOM opportunities. We are looking to leverage our success in VirTrap [ph] and that's a maybe contract and DoD expertise to extend this in search and rescue mission. We are pursuing expansion opportunities through the Fly America Act. We are looking to expand our product offerings into GOCO opportunities this is government supplied aircraft in currently all of our businesses with aircraft that we provide, government does have contracts where they have assets and they look for contractors like us to provide a lift without providing the actual equipment. And then continuing with our fleet optimization to achieve the greatest operating profit potential. So as we look at the quarter have ended although our revenues were down by 13 million, the profit contribution from this business was relatively flat. So there was virtually no degradation in earnings contribution from the business with even though they had less contract positions and less revenue. That pretty much concludes my discussion around aviation services. Let me move over to Technology Products. In this segment sales were down 4.8% to $107 million even though we had sales growth in our cargo systems and container business where we had sales increase of $4 million. This was offset by mobility products where we had good visibility. We knew that there would be a soft period. Sales were down $6 million in that period. So and as we mentioned earnings release we did renew and signed some new contracts for the mobility business and we do expect fourth quarter revenues to be higher for that business than third quarter revenues were. So our management focus in this segment is a continued ramp of the A400M program, execution of our successful cargo strategy for Telair and Nordisk, expense of our mobility products offering through continued innovation, continue to come up with lighter weight solution and capture new customers as we’ve been in this period with the British. Deepening growth, the engineering solutions work with OEMs and continue to improve their performance of our precision machining operations. I’ll say just before I turn the call over to John, I could say that historically our businesses we have experienced rotation in our performance around customer requirements and shifting markets and as we sit here today we see near-term demand for Airlift and certain MRO services declined but we do see an increase in supply chain activity as indicated by some of the deals that we just recently mentioned. So if I look back in time, if I look at the first decade a century, we have a clearly robot aircraft sales and leasing activity contributing sales and earnings to the company and when the financial crisis of July hit that business more or less, now suffered than we managed our way largely out of that activity, and our mobility business picked up. And surely after mobility went down we had good growth at Telair and Airlift. Now Airlift is done, and we’re looking for contribution from our supply chain. So I think this is a historical kind of perspective for the company. This quarter I think we got quite a little short. We then see – we knew the contracts that were coming off, but we are hoping to get new contracts as commenced we have in the past that would replace but I just might that I’m very proud aside from the disappointment on the sale side at least on the earnings side we were able to keep that relatively respectable. So, with that thank you for your attention, I would like to turn it over to John to provide some additional financial color.
John C. Fortson:
Thanks David. I would like to refer everyone to our press release for general financial information for this quarter and use this time to hold on some specific actions we are taking to rightsize and manage our costs and capital structures in this environment. I will be available after the call to answer any questions you may have. The impact of the revenue decline in earnings was reduced by aggressive cost management and operational efficiencies, particularly at Airlift where we experience significant revenue decline, but had higher operating margins, and as David mentioned had a net effect of income from this business to be flat year-over-year. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 9.6% for the third quarter compared to 8.0% for last year. However last year included a onetime benefit of $9 million from an acquisition adjustment. If you adjust for this, our SG&A for this quarter was approximately $5 million lower or about 10%. We will continue to make adjustments to our cost structure where appropriate to reflect these lower sales levels. We are in the process reviewing all sources of spend cross the company about strategic and non-strategic defined cost savings. We will complete our reviews our healthcare insurance as well as freight and travel. We are now focused on other non-strategic spinning areas. As result of this quarter, we identified and taken actions that should result in approximately $4 million a year savings. This does include the elimination of certain positions and the restructuring of some functions including IT as well as other non-personal relative reductions. As communicated in our press release, given the actual third quarter results in our expectations for the fourth quarter we are adjusting both our revenue and diluted earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2014. For the full year we are reducing our revenue guidance by $100 million to a range of $2 billion to $2.05 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $79 to $82 per share. Thanks for your attention, and operator, we are now ready to take your questions.
Operator:
Yes sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Arnie Ursaner:
Good afternoon, it’s actually Arnie Ursaner backing up Larry on the call. So I have a couple of quick questions for you. First on the financial side, you mentioned, last year you had an earn-out reduction or reversal if you will, was there any reversal this year in the SG&A line?
John C. Fortson:
No, that was kind of one-off related to a transaction we did overseas, but we haven’t done a similar type of adjustment this year.
Arnie Ursaner:
Okay, what’s your tax rate view for Q4?
John C. Fortson:
We did have this one-time adjustment that we talked about in the press release, but our effective tax rate is going to remain at 34.5% going forward.
Arnie Ursaner:
Okay. And obviously one of the positives and negatives ignored given the quarter is the fact that you signed on a huge number of very significant, very positive contracts. Can you speak about the working capital and overall investments the company will have to make to realize the benefit of some of these very attractive long-term plans?
John C. Fortson:
Yes, so we have actually already started on the unnamed customer, we have obviously made investments and then we’ve made some investments in advance for the Sabena transaction. When you look at this quarter, we actually did invest pretty heavily on our growth both for our sort of traditional transaction business, but also these programs to give you an idea, the order of magnitude and as you probably know, this doesn’t really run through our CapEx line, but we spend about $27 million between the two between parts and engines over the course of this quarter. So we are going to have to continue to make some investments, but we are going to sequence through them. We think these things give us the right returns going forward.
Arnie Ursaner:
Thank you. I will jump back in queue. Thanks.
Operator:
Thank you (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Julie Yates of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart:
Good evening.
David P. Storch:
Hi Julie.
John C. Fortson:
Hi Julie.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart:
Hi, so this is the second quarter really guys have lowered EPS guidance about 14% below where you started the year excluding the tax benefit. So as you are preparing to give guidance in July for FY 2015, what are you doing differently and how should we think about the level of visibility that you have and the confidence around FY 2015?
John C. Fortson:
Well, I think first of all, I will get through FY 2014 and I think that we are trying to share with you that we are positioning ourselves with some of these new contract wins to give us a little bit more dependable revenue base if you will. This is an unusual period for us, because historically we have been able to replace business. I am not sure and I am trying to, I guess get a handle around the impact that the weather may have had in terms of disrupting some of our operations, because it was a little bit unusual in terms of not being able to win certain new businesses and that didn’t happen should we typically would have won. So I believe we have a fairly good visibility, fairly we’re disappointed here in terms of this quarter’s result, but yes, I think that as we come into July, we should have pretty good visibility.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart:
Okay. And then David, last quarter I think you said that mobility products have reached kind of a steady state, it looks like it’s going to continue to be a bit soft here?
David P. Storch:
No, this is purely compared to prior year and that they should have a very decent fourth quarter.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart:
Okay. And then I recall last quarter you did talk about some of the weakness for the second half for the cash flow as you’ve invested in some of these programs…
David P. Storch:
Right.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart:
But this is obviously the weakest it’s been in eight quarters, you had a really good performance.
John C. Fortson:
Right.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart:
How should we think about cash flow in the fourth quarter and even any preliminary indications you can give on next year?
John C. Fortson:
We’re going to have some cash going out on the bounce of the Sabena deal. So I think as we ramp in some of these new contracts, there will be some cash going out. As I look out into next year assuming surely from standpoint of our existing customer, our existing business phase, I’d expect our free cash to exceed our after-tax income. I expect to be over that 100% number that we’ve experienced in the last eight quarters as you mentioned. So I think we should be generating some pretty good cash flow next year.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart:
Okay. And then last one from me, any update on Lake Charles?
John C. Fortson:
Yes, Lake Charles has been inactive of late. We completed the contracts that were there when we took on the business and now we are bidding work, but as we sit here today, we haven’t had any success here, but I think everyday has to be just a little bit patient only because we just got the EASA certification in September and we’re trying to figure out how to go ahead and tie [ph] people there in a way that we can still make a buck on it. So, be a little patient, look back on the Indianapolis now the first couple of years of our Indianapolis adventure, in our mostly even vacant eventually we got some business and we’ve been able to grow from there. So, we still believe that we are positioned well there we just need a little bit more time to break into some accounts.
Julie A. Yates-Stewart:
All right, thank you.
John C. Fortson:
Yes.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Hojo of Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.
Tyler E. Hojo:
Yes, good evening. I want to ask you first about the NATO contract that was announced or the NATO weather of intent I should call it I guess, does the $27 million in working capital investment that was already NATO, does that include NATO as well?
John C. Fortson:
No, it does not.
Tyler E. Hojo:
Okay, when does that start to hit?
John C. Fortson:
We’ll start making investment in that this quarter.
Tyler E. Hojo:
Okay.
David P. Storch:
And then we’ll have, there will be a ramp in investment over the next two-year period as the EJs start coming into the fleet.
Tyler E. Hojo:
Okay, but even with that investment, do you think still think free cash flow in fiscal 2015 is going to exceed net income, is that correct?
John C. Fortson:
Yes, yes.
Tyler E. Hojo:
Okay. All right, thanks for that clarification. And then, in regards to I think the $200 million contract value that you cited for me, how should we think about that ramping over the next 10, 12years?
John C. Fortson:
So I believe they get to the 30 aircrafts in three years if I’m not mistaken and so once we get to that point that should stay relatively constant. So, as the aircraft commence the fleet, the revenues kicks in, but once we get to the year three, the aircraft will be starting to require their C check as well. So, I would say probably will get to full ramp by year five would be my guess.
Tyler E. Hojo:
Okay.
David P. Storch:
And you’ll have the, aircraft would have been in service, all the aircrafts would have been in service and all the aircrafts would have been through at least one C check.
Tyler E. Hojo:
Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, just some regards to the restructuring initiatives that were called out I believe the number of $4 million was drawn out in terms of the savings. Is there any expense associated with these restructuring initiatives that’s included in the Q4 guidance?
John C. Fortson:
There will be some and it is in the guidance, so obviously there will be some severance related to some people that will be departing the firm, but that’s part of the bulk of it, but it’s in the guidance.
Tyler E. Hojo:
Okay. Can you call it out or just not going to?
John C. Fortson:
I’m rather not, but…
Tyler E. Hojo:
Okay.
David P. Storch:
Tyler if I may, let me go back to the question on Mesa for second and – the current agreement that Mesa has with the United Express is for 30 aircraft. I believe Mesa is optimistic as they perform and United Express grow their ERG fleet that though get more aircraft under their contracts. And so there might be a follow-on work there as well just kind of far that away if you don’t mind.
Tyler E. Hojo:
Yes that will be great. Okay, may be one follow-on just in regards to Mesa, those of us that have followed the name for a long time remember the last Mesa contract and kind of how that was a bit painful back in 4 to 5 years ago or so. Is there anyway that you can protect yourself or is it just a function of – this is a better aircraft that’s more in demand.
David P. Storch:
I think that’s the way to look at it. I believe and this contract we negotiate not just with Mesa but also with United. And United fairly in better shape today than they were let’s say last quarter around, so. Yes, my belief is that you have brand new equipment, the 70 seaters as opposed to the 50 seaters and our view is that we should be protected on the asset. And that, time will tell of course.
Tyler E. Hojo:
Okay, great. And just one last one for me if I may, just in regards to the tech product segment, really nice margin improvement sequentially in the quarter. And I’m just kind of wondering how we should think about the movement in margin in that segment on a go-forward basis?
John C. Fortson:
David mentioned that we’re expecting improvement that mobility in the fourth quarter and I think you should actually see more of the same as we go forward there.
Tyler E. Hojo:
Okay, great. That’s all I had. Thanks a lot.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Ciabattoni of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Thanks, good afternoon, guys. First question, I guess on the NATO 18 contract, maybe some color on what might be holding up those initial task orders. I know you’d been modeling before this year. And then may be if you could talk about I have taken a number of kind of – what's the ramp for next year on that contract that you are kind of looking at, at this point?
David P. Storch:
Yes. The NATO 18 contract was released, we were advised which aircraft we are going to get and then with the political turmoil and the elections and our government’s inability to work with Cargo just put everything on hold. We are hopeful that with the new government coming into Afghanistan that we’ll start to see these aircrafts start to be activated, but I don’t know if that’s going to be in April or July or when so, it’s pretty tough to predict a ramp there and we haven’t really been successful to-date on predicting when we think we’ll kick in. In terms of next year, there is a series of opportunities some one we choosy and then one particular that’s very, very large and I think we last quarter, called it a game changer and that would be pick most of next fiscal year to work through, get awarded and start to some of the place in it and quite frankly we haven’t seen the final RP on that yet. So we’re looking to see some more aircraft come out of the portfolio as we go into fiscal 2015 and then start to put more aircraft in on these by winning some of these competitions that we’re getting today.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Great, thanks. You have had some nice wins in the supply chain business over the last few months, just wondering if you could talk about looking forward what the pipeline for that business looks like and maybe more specifically what you guys are seeing in terms of the potential for more of the programmatic wins which I know something you look to kind of ship that business towards?
David P. Storch:
These things are the way of kind of building off each other, so we’re hopeful that by securing, there have been programs for instance that that will lead to additional business in that field, they could be, not investing in this business for the last few years. So on talking with the people and the business unit, we have a sense that we can possibly win some additional business in that region. So I think what I am trying to signal in my commentary was as a result some of these wins, the airline expandable win, the Eaton win, the Sabena win that there will be more of this kind of activity in each of those streams coming forward.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay, thanks. The supply chain contract in the quarter that you restructured from Time and Material to Power-by-the-Hour, what was the driver there for changing the structure of that contract, was that coming from you, from the customers, just kind of wondering what that played out?
David P. Storch:
When we won that contract, you may recall there was an airline, there was a ex-airline maintenance base that was providing the maintenance and again this is one of those situations where we’re not supposed to be discussing who the airline is, by I will explain to you, you might be able to get to the conclusion, but basically the MRO disappointed the airline was when bankrupt and they had a design that were holding a fair amount of that airlines inventory. So there was no way to price power and they have been operating under power by our agreement, frequent price Power-by-the-Hour nor do they want us to, so we work on a Time and Material basis for year and so we project the Power-by-the-Hour agreement, so we could gain more knowledge and then negotiate Power-by-the-Hour agreement. So it was always intended to go Power-by-the-Hour, it was just a temporary experience to go Time and Material. So this is always planned in the process of going Power-by-the-Hour calls for, it drive the less revenue number, but the profitability is approximately the same.
Kevin Ciabattoni:
Okay, that’s helpful on that. I will jump back in queue.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from J.B. Groh of D.A. Davidson. Your question please.
J.B. Groh:
Hey guys most of my questions have been answered. Can you may be lay out the timing in the cash flow bookings for that sale of the nine aircraft?
David P. Storch:
Yes, I mean look they are available for sale now I don’t know if we can give you a real prediction as to when we would expect this stock share to be sold, but some of them are back in the U.S., some of them are in transit back to the U.S. and then some of them are actually going to be moved to a location in the Middle East where we think we might have a better chance at marketing them. So we are pushing down hard to get something done this quarter, it’s not a uncertainty, but certainly over the next six months.
J.B. Groh:
Could you give us may be the book value alone or?
David P. Storch:
Yes I mean the nine that we have for sale right now on the books for about $18.8 million.
J.B. Groh:
Okay and the price value would be above or below that?
David P. Storch:
The expectation is to make a gain.
J.B. Groh:
Okay, good. Okay thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from [indiscernible]. Your question please.
Unidentified Analyst:
Hi guys.
David P. Storch:
Hi John.
Unidentified Analyst:
Thanks for taking my questions, and most of them are answered. But so in at the early part what – could you give me a color on what drove the increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales that you went up by about 160 basis points?
David P. Storch:
Well, okay. So, we talked about this a little bit, but yes it’s compared it on an apples-to apples-base shares, you have to make an adjustments the third quarter of last year’s number because there was an acquisition adjustment made in that. So when you add back to last year’s number, that sort of $9 million was part of that actually are SG&A itself by about $5 million.
Unidentified Analyst:
Okay.
David P. Storch:
Will provide and so adjustment numbers really a kind of one-off related.
Unidentified Analyst:
Right.
David P. Storch:
That particular deal.
Unidentified Analyst:
For the most recent quarters SG&A figure is more in line?
David P. Storch:
normalized.
Unidentified Analyst:
Normalized okay?
David P. Storch:
Correct.
Unidentified Analyst:
And then in terms of your availability, liquidity under your revolvers what’s the kind of estimated figure right now?
David P. Storch:
So we have lots of liquidity, its a quarter close, we’ve had close to $400 million available and that’s prior to any incremental [indiscernible] or anything else.
Unidentified Analyst:
Okay. So excluding the $115 million or so cash about $285 million and your revolver still there that level.
David P. Storch:
Right.
Unidentified Analyst:
Okay. Fine that’s all I had and the rest were answered. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Stan Mann Stan Mann of Mann Family. Your line is open.
Stan Mann:
Hi gentlemen, I have four quick questions for David.
David P. Storch:
Yes go ahead Stan.
Stan Mann:
Question one, any effect that you foresee in the near-term or far-term on the American Airline merger been effecting there?
David P. Storch:
No I mean it’s kind of, we are making – there is a progress and we will keep working it.
Stan Mann:
Okay so there is nothing specific or that we can expect?
David P. Storch:
Nothing that I see at this moment, but we continue to work it.
Stan Mann:
Okay. Two, looking forward couple of several years how do you feel about top-line growth, I mean this quarter was weak, but what do you see looking down the road, I mean how is your feel?
David P. Storch:
So assuming that the general economy were to grow at like call it for argument sake 3%, I would expect our growth rate to be around 10%.
Stan Mann:
Okay, and what’s the positive view? very positive.
David P. Storch:
Yes.
Stan Mann:
Okay three, there is a little bit more complicated, you are moving into Europe with Sabena deal, that’s correct?
David P. Storch:
I won’t say moving into Europe, we have been in Europe, I think we’re kind of in a – kind of increasing our investments in Europe, yeah.
Stan Mann:
Okay, well thank the every other companies that does international business favor that I follow has a much lower tax rate and takes advantage of the geographic move for taxes. Your tax rate is inordinately high for a corporation that has international exposure. So, can I ask you think that we might get a base in Ireland or something that will give us the ability to drop our tax rate?
David P. Storch:
Let them kind of play around with that and let us give some thoughts to that, before we comment and then get back to you on that, because we didn’t make this acquisition with that mine, but clearly we have actually in the aviation where the fair amount of fall through based in Dublin for that purpose. So let us kind a play around and see if that’s an option for us. We have much thoughts about we don’t really know at this stage as that meaningful for us. Now let me, let me add to that, although the operations is headquartered in Brussels keep in mind now also one of the motivation is to increase our Middle East and Africa business where fleet sizes are grown.
Stan Mann:
Rapidly.
David P. Storch:
Yes, yes, yes.
Stan Mann:
But the tax question, the tax question is legitimate and substantial. And I want to be there your legal, your high relative to anybody doing business internationally. And of the interest in area for bottom line?
David P. Storch:
But we will take that constructively and let us do the work on that and then we’ll let you know, okay.
Stan Mann:
I have one last question, in any area of your business, did you have liquidity? Do you sense or are you working on or do you see the possibility of starting acquisition program again, which is kind of delayed for a while?
David P. Storch:
So, we didn’t delay it for any real reasonably, we’ve still been looking or thinking about acquisitions, we know feel a lot more courageous today with the stronger balance sheet position and we do see some opportunities obviously my preference is to grow organically and I think in this quarter although we kind of didn’t perform from sales standpoint we did perform from the standpoint of winning some new business contracts. So my preference would be organic growth and we will look to supplement that organic growth with what we considered to be appropriate acquisitions. We do have a couple of one acquisition in particular which will give us one acquisition [indiscernible] I should say, which should give us some additional possibilities for a new revenue stream and we are looking at that situation very closely to that.
Stan Mann:
Okay. You’ve been very successful in opportunistic acquisition that’s why I asked for a question.
David P. Storch:
Thank you.
Stan Mann:
But anyway, thank you very much.
David P. Storch:
Thank you, sir.
Operator:
Thank you. And as they appear to be no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
David P. Storch:
Well, thank you for your question today. I appreciate your interest in our company and let us get back to work. Thank you.
Operator:

Operator:
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the AAR CORP. 2014 Fiscal Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now I'll turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Chris Mason. Please begin.
Chris Mason:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our earnings release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2013. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR CORP. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David P. Storch:
Hey, thanks, Chris. And with me here in our Chicago offices would be John Fortson, our Chief Financial Officer; Tim Romenesko, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Sharp, our Chief Accounting Officer. I thought what I'd do today is kick this session off by providing a half year or a 6-month overview of our company and our businesses, our performance and our strategies and then drill down a little further into the quarter's results and then pass it over to John to provide some color around the financials. Let me start by going through a performance review, drilling down into our Aviation Services businesses, and then I'll talk about our Technology Products businesses. So starting with Aviation Services, we have the 3 different interrelated activities
John C. Fortson:
Thanks, David. I will provide a little more color around the financial performance of the company during the second quarter, including comments around interest, cash flow, capital expenditures and capital structure. And Mike Sharp and I both will be available after the call to answer any questions that you may have. Revenues in the first quarter were $540.7 million versus the prior year level of $512.8 million. Aviation Services revenue at $424.7 million was up 8.7% in comparison to the year -- the prior year. As David mentioned, all of the businesses in this segment performed well. Technology Products revenue were -- was $116 million and declined 4.9% from last year's levels as a result of softer sales in our cargo systems and container operations. In our mobility systems, this is the first quarter since the second quarter of 2012 in which sales were on a comparable basis from a demand level, and we expect them to remain steady going forward. During the quarter, sales to commercial customers were 57% of total sales compared to 60% of consolidated sales in the second quarter of last year, with the balance of sales attributable to government and defense. The second quarter defense sales included the sale or include the delivery of 2 aircraft to the U.S. Marshals Service. Consolidated gross profit margin in the first quarter was 16.8% compared to 17% margin in the prior year first quarter. As mentioned in our release, margins in Aviation Services segments declined to 16.8% from 17.2% in the prior year period as a result of unfavorable margin mix. On the Technology Products side, margins increased to 17% in comparison with the prior year. Similarly, the first quarter in fiscal year 2014, we did a great job of cost management this quarter, bringing SG&A as a percentage of sales to 9.5% from 9.9% in the prior year quarter as a result of a combination of higher sales and effective cost management. We remain focused on cost control across the company and expect further progress. Operating profit at 7.5% for the quarter was 10 bps better than prior year quarter. As we've said before, improving our operating profitability is a focus across the company, and we're pleased to see this margin improvement. We also remain very focused on cash generation. During the second quarter, we generated $38.8 million of cash from operations. We had $7.1 million in capital expenditures and $31.7 million of free cash flow. Further, we paid $3 million in dividends. Net interest expense for the first quarter was $10.2 million, a decrease from $10.5 million in the prior year. We continue to delever the company. And as of November 30, net debt was reduced by $29 million sequentially and by $127 million from November 30, 2012. As David mentioned, our net debt levels are down by almost $180 million from its peak in Q3 of fiscal year 2012 right after we closed the acquisition of Telair and Nordisk. Depreciation and amortization, including amortization of stock-based compensation, was $22.3 million during the second quarter. Our second quarter diluted earnings per share is based on 39.2 million shares in our diluted share count, which is down 2.3 million shares from last year's level. As communicated in our press release, given our expectations for fewer aircraft positions at our airlift operations during the second half of the year, we are adjusting both our revenue and diluted earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2014. For the full year, we expect to generate revenues in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.95 to $2 per share. Thanks for your attention. And operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Julie Yates Stewart of Credit Suisse.
Julie Yates - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division:
On the supply chain, last quarter, you talked about the customer deferrals of having maintenance on engines. It sounded like, from your comments, that this has improved some. Can you just give us an update on what you're seeing in the business?
David P. Storch:
We had strength in the quarter, and we have made some investments in inventory for anticipated strength continuing into Q3 and Q4. So the business clearly had a dip in Q1, but it is not exactly where we wanted to be but significantly higher than Q1. So Q2 was a good quarter. And we anticipate, with some investments we've recently made in Q2, that we would anticipate that we'll have some strength in Qs 3 and 4.
Julie Yates - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division:
Okay. And then on the -- with your comments on the distribution business and the win with the major airline, can you help us understand exactly what you guys are doing on the distribution side and whether you're starting to compete with the likes of Wesco and B/E here?
Michael J. Sharp:
Julie, in this particular situation, we are really taking over the supply of consumable and expendable products for the airline, so everything from the sourcing of the parts to delivering it to the bins at the airline. So it's an extension of what we've been doing, but -- and it's similar to what some of the others are doing. But it's an area that -- where we're leveraging our systems, we're leveraging our relationships and we're leveraging our core capabilities.
Julie Yates - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division:
Okay. And then just lastly on the guidance. If you guys can help us understand the positives and the negatives, with the positives being the new acquisition, the distribution contracts and the negative being airlift and perhaps a little bit of weakness in the cargo side, just maybe helping us size those different pieces.
John C. Fortson:
Yes. So Julie, it's John. Yes, I mean, look, as we've thought about it, this has obviously been -- there's been a lot of planning and analysis going on and particularly as we've gotten sort of more visibility around what airlift is going to do, right? It has been a particularly strong first half of the year. I think from our perspective, you can kind of look at the aircraft positions and make a rough guesstimate as to how we think the business will impact in the back half of the year. It will get offset by positive contributions, particularly, I think, in the fourth quarter in the supply chain parts of our business, and also offset by some improvement in our Technology Products, specifically our commercial Cargo Loading Systems business. So positive supply chain, positive cargo loading services offsetting and mitigating some of the downward pressure that you're seeing from airlift.
Operator:
Next question is from Larry Solow of CJS Securities.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
David, can you just clarify that the 40 positions, if that was a fiscal year-end '12 or calendar year-end '12? I know you're saying 30 at calendar year end now, basically, and then back to -- or 20 now and then back to 29 at the end of calendar '14, is that what you're saying, or are these fiscal years?
David P. Storch:
Yes, so fiscal -- starting the fiscal year, we had 40 positions. We lost a few positions between end of the fiscal year and now. And then we're -- and so expecting for -- from fiscal year start to end where we had start with 40, of those 40, 20 are going to go away is our best estimate...
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Right, by fiscal year end of the...
David P. Storch:
And then we believe between now and fiscal year end, we will come -- we will win 9 new positions.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Got it. So basically, from now, you already -- you basically, had you lost a few positions already or are you really...
David P. Storch:
Yes.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Right, okay.
David P. Storch:
Yes, we had lost some positions in Q2.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay. And the position, the 9 you expect to add, is that mostly -- is that assuming that some deal gets some of these task orders? Is that...
David P. Storch:
Yes, yes. And we're expect -- yes, so we're hoping that -- we're expecting the protest -- we believe the protest is frivolous. And we believe that will be over -- that will be ruled in our favor. So those would be 2 that would go back -- going to Africa. We believe that we're probably going to win -- we're in the vicinity of 4 to 5 task orders in Afghanistan. And then we believe there's another 2 rotary wings that we'll win in Africa.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay. Okay, so that will the increment -- additional 2 incremental that you haven't announced yet for Africa?
David P. Storch:
You're correct.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
And the 4 to 5 task orders, you say you think you'd get, that's of the potential 18 that you could get, not today, but in theory?
David P. Storch:
Yes, that's correct.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay, okay. Just a couple of other questions, the 5-year contract you just announced, the $40 million to $45 million, is that a potential number, is that a number you have to ramp towards? How should we look at that?
Michael J. Sharp:
That's our expectation of the first year performance. We do think that there's opportunities to build on that. Larry, just to maybe follow up a little bit on Julie's question too, I mean, we provide this kind of support for our own internal shops. It's just that we haven't had large programs like this with external customers. So it's something that we know very well, and we expect that we can build off of this program with this customer and with other new customers.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay. And the distribution agreement with Eaton that you announced, is that -- can you put any numbers to that? I mean, is that somewhat small -- I imagine in like the Unison deal, but how does that compare? Is it much smaller? Is it -- can you put any quantification on that?
David P. Storch:
It's, in the zip code, slightly smaller. But we prefer -- I think at their request, we prefer not to put the numbers to that.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
So that would be -- it's actually a decent size. And does that one take longer to ramp? Because I know Unison took a while, and I don't know...
David P. Storch:
Yes, you'll see that will take a little longer. Unison, of course, had a much broader range of customers; this has a narrower range. So I think it probably shouldn't take quite as long, but there will be a ramp period there.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
And is Unison now up to like this $60 million that it was, I think -- when it was signed, that it's supposed to be. Is that ballpark to where it is now?
David P. Storch:
Yes, I think it's a little bit less than that, but it's clearly meaningful.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay. And then just a couple of other quickies. Duluth, I guess, you're up to your third line. Is there -- is that -- do you see that going to 4 anytime soon? Or is that -- is 3 sort of a number you expect for the near term?
David P. Storch:
The goal is to get to 4, and I think let's get through 3. It's a manning challenge. And at this time of year, people aren't dying to fly up to Duluth to work.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Yes, it's snowing. Yes, you're right. So maybe in the summer...
David P. Storch:
Yes, right. Right.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
And how about the other facility, in the Miami -- they're all running -- it sounds like they're all running pretty high...
David P. Storch:
I think Q2, they ran strong. I think Q3, we get into the holiday season, you should expect some softness there, but typical, nothing unusual.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
And mobility, was that actually -- was that flat year-over-year or was it -- I thought it was supposed to be down a little more this quarter and then sort of flatten out -- it's pretty flat.
David P. Storch:
I think relatively flat, slightly, slightly down, but not in a meaningful way.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
And you see it sort of being flat at least in the near term, is that fair to say?
David P. Storch:
Yes, right.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Tyler Hojo of Sidoti & Company.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Just the first question is just if you look at commercial aviation sales in aggregate, it looks like those volumes are roughly flat year-on-year in 2Q. And just when I go through kind of the prepared commentary, obviously, MRO is up, supply chain is up. Just kind of wondering what the offset is. Is that -- is the offset on the precision business? Just a little help there.
John C. Fortson:
Yes, I think, that's fair, all right? It's softness around precision and also in our cargo loading systems businesses, right? So it's Technology Products that kind of drove it. But your correct, it's kind of flat to down like 1%.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Okay. And could you maybe talk a little bit about what -- what's going to be the catalyst to turn precision around? I think, David, you said Q1, you were expecting kind of a shift in that business.
David P. Storch:
Yes, and we have had improvement. So the Q2 is better than Q1. It's still low, operating in the red, I guess, was my point. And we've got -- so the team operating the business now, we shifted the management in early summer. And the business now reports to our mobility GM and who reports to Dany Kleiman who you may have met, Tyler. And Dany, before he left Israel Aircraft (sic) [Aerospace] Industries, was running their MRO business, the deck aviation. But before that, he was in charge of their manufacturing plant, building the airplane, the G250, as well as building parts for Boeing under contract. So he has -- they put some discipline in place, which will -- which has already yielded improvements. We now have to win customer confidence back. And we've -- we did some -- I made a comment about bonehead decision, what -- one of the prior manager have made some pricing decisions that, quite frankly, pissed off some of the customers. So we're now trying to recover some of those customer relations, and I think the key to recovering customer relations is doing a fabulous job on operational stuff. And so the guys are fixing the operation, which I think is getting close to where we want to be and now we have to regain the customer confidence and make them feel good -- make them feel better about what we're doing and then probably give some price concessions so that we regain their trust.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Okay. But longer term, David, are we still thinking that precision could be additive to kind of the long-term margin goals that you [indiscernible] ?
David P. Storch:
Absolutely, and it should be. And it's really -- I mean, I've got to watch my language because I'm not happy about it, but we really have, to put it mildly, stubbed our toe. I mean this is, of all our different subset markets, this is probably the healthiest of all the markets. So we should be enjoying some of what's going on in the build cycle in this business, and we're not. So we've got to fix it. We know we have to do confidence in the team that we have in place today to fix it. And I would hope that next year, at this time, while we're talking, it will be contributing to the profitability and hopefully additive to margins.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Okay, wonderful. And just maybe on another topic. When you talk about the, I guess, it's 11 airlift assets that are going to be unutilized at the end of this fiscal year, just curious what kind of the current thinking is surrounding them. I mean, would you prefer to sell them or place them somewhere else?
David P. Storch:
Well, there's probably 7 assets that we would probably look to sell. And because one of the things that we'd like to do is simplify the fleet. So at one point in time, we're operating 9 aircraft type. And if we sell these 3 aircraft type, we've already gotten rid of 1 aircraft type, we'd be down to 5 -- 2 fixed-wing type, the Havlin-8s [ph] and CASA 212s, and then we'd be down to 3 rotary wings, which would be the S-92s, the S-61s and the Puma. So that would be ideal state for us. So -- but let's see with that -- we have one of the aircraft that we have out, the CASA 235s, we actually have some requirements for, so we're kind of arm wrestling as to whether we want to -- what we want to do exactly with those requirements.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Okay, that's interesting. And maybe just one follow-on to that. Kind of one of the discussions, at least I've been having, is just what some of the underlying value is with some of the airlift assets that's on your books, do you have any idea what the market value is of the 7 birds that you're looking to sell?
David P. Storch:
Yes, the book value is $30 million. And we think the market value is pretty close to that level. And hey, Tyler, if you're still there, the value I gave you includes all the spares that support those fleet types as well. So it's the aircraft themselves, plus the spares, engines and spares.

The next question is from Kevin Ciabattoni of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division:
Looking at the recent distribution of supply chain wins, Eaton and the unnamed airline customer, can you give us an idea of what -- are there meaningful startup costs involved in those in terms of infrastructure, inventory, what have you, that may be kind of dilutive to margins early on?
Michael J. Sharp:
There aren't really any significant startup costs. We will be putting a team in place. We're going to be warehousing this out of one of our existing facilities. We're going to take on some additional space in that facility. We'll invest a little bit of capital to mezzanine the shipping area. In terms of the provisioning of the inventory, we will be and have started issuing purchase orders, so there'll be working capital investment. But no costs or startup costs that are significant that would have a negative impact on margins.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division:
Okay, perfect. And then on the airlift, you mentioned you hadn't received any task orders for the NATO contract in Afghanistan. But I assume that that is still -- that contract is still included in the outlook for the year, despite the fact you understate orders, is that correct?
David P. Storch:
Yes, it's part of the reason for kind of our taking a softer look at the second half earnings because we had originally been anticipating that those task orders would have been issued by now and that we have had the benefit of those assets operating in Q3. We're now a little bit -- we're taking a more cautious view and thinking it's going to take a little longer. Of course, we still have the task orders to go ahead and deploy those assets.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division:
Okay. And then in airlift, you mentioned at the beginning of the call a large opportunity you're looking at kind of outside of the existing business. I was just wondering, I mean, can you give us any color whether that -- what kind of end market, I mean, are we looking at military, government, commercial? Can you give us any color on where that would be?
David P. Storch:
Yes, let's call it government.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division:
Okay, fair enough. And then last one from me. It's kind of a longer-term question, but we saw Air Canada order a number of Boeing narrow-bodies recently. Just wondering long term what the impact of that shift would be at Duluth?
David P. Storch:
Well, longer term, it depends on what you're talking about, right, in terms of longer term. I mean, at some point in time, obviously, today, in Duluth, we're doing their A320 fleet. I would expect that the order from Boeing was to replace some of those assets. I'm not sure -- I don't recall, although I believe I did see it, but I don't recall when those aircraft come into the Air Canada's fleet.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division:
Yes, 2017 would be the earliest that they're looking at at this point.
David P. Storch:
Yes, yes. Yes, so I think as they phase in, I don't know how many a year of the -- whether they ordered 69 or...
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division:
In the ballpark, about [indiscernible] that number.
David P. Storch:
Yes. So I think there were 80 A320s currently in the fleet, if I remember correctly. So I would imagine that over time, they'll be transitioning A320s out and probably transitioning 737s in.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division:
And you would be able to, I mean, at this point, obviously, that's a ways off, but you think you'd be able to handle the Boeing aircraft in Duluth?
David P. Storch:
Absolutely. I have to check the stats to know if we can handle 3 or 4. But we would definitely be able to handle at least 3.
Operator:
Next question is from J. B. Groh of D.A. Davidson.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
You mentioned the working capital investment, is there any way to -- on some of these new contracts, is there a way to quantify that? Or how should we think about it in terms of kind of days of inventory versus that $40 million to $45 million?
Michael J. Sharp:
Yes. I think we should see inventory turns in that program of 3x to 4x. Maybe not right at the start, but I think it should have decent turns.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
Okay. And this is -- Okay, so a little bit of it. Okay, not a huge -- very slow event. And then what's the pace on the A400M now? You said 3 for the quarter. Is that kind of what the expectation is over the next several quarters?
Michael J. Sharp:
It moves around. Some are a little more than that. But yes, it's starting to get into a pretty, pretty good ramp here. So yes, it goes up from here.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
And that all shows up in technology?
Michael J. Sharp:
Correct.
David P. Storch:
Let me, if I may, you made a comment about the terms and investments in those -- for those programs. Let me also add one more thing and that we mentioned it in the question that Julie asked about the -- some of our businesses in the spare parts arena. We did, in this quarter, generate meaningful cash -- positive cash flow, and in cash flow in excess of our net after-tax earnings. And keep in mind that, that includes a significant investment in inventory to support our supply chain business. So we increased our supply chain inventory by approximately $20 million that should go ahead and augur well for Q3 and Q4 in that business, so the cash flow taken into consideration investments in inventory to support the growth of the business.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
That's almost -- I mean, I guess, I always kind of look at those as kind of like an acquisition almost, right? I mean...
David P. Storch:
Absolutely.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
And then so maybe you could, hopping back in here, sort of prioritize cash flow deployment. It sounds like you're working on potential -- some other potential transactions, but what else?
David P. Storch:
Yes, clearly, as you know, I mean, we're -- our supply -- we are supporting and growing our supply chain, looking to support and grow our supply chain businesses. So there will be capital applied to those businesses. And I signaled in my strategic overview some additional things that we're looking to do to build out our capabilities. So we're feeling pretty good about where we stand right now in terms of opportunities for capital deployment. And it helps that we generate the kind of cash that we have over the last 1 to 1.5 years.
Operator:
Next question is from Jon Braatz of Kansas City Capital.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
Most of my questions were answered. I was going to ask about the A400. But in your text, you talked about the sales of 2 aircraft to the U.S. Marshals Service. How much was that, and was there any profit associated with it?
David P. Storch:
It was a fairly thin-margin transaction. I think we're -- we may have announced, or I don't recall precisely if we announced the sales, and we may be prohibited from doing that. But it was a relatively thin-margin transaction. One of the things that we're trying to secure there, keep in mind that their headquarter, their air operation is at the Oklahoma City Airport where we have our maintenance operation. We are goal/ambition to do the maintenance support for that fleet of aircraft.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
Okay. So how many aircraft do you have now remaining in your portfolio?
David P. Storch:
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
Six, okay. Okay. Any timetable that you would like to reduce that by? Do you have a timetable?
David P. Storch:
Yes, I'd like to get them done by the end of the quarter, if we could, but I don't think it's going to happen. I think, realistically, I think that we have 2 767s on lease with United. Those come down nicely, I'm not sure yet. I think those expire in '16 or '17 -- '15, '16, so I'm not sure if we've we heard from United yet as to what their intentions might be at that stage. Keep in mind, they've invested fairly heavily in the interiors on that aircraft. So just not sure what their plan is. And then we have 747 on lease with Delta that they have plans to operate for a long time. I guess we have that in the finance category now. And -- so yes, I would say that I would anticipate this fleet will move out of our portfolio in the next 3 to 4 years.
Operator:
The next question is from Stan Manning [ph] of Manning Family Investors [ph].
Unknown Analyst:
Several questions. One, can you talk to the thoughts on the American-US Air merger and its possible effects on your business?
David P. Storch:
First of all, I think it's good for the industry. I think it has a potential of being positive for us. The US Air management team is integrating, I think, well with the American management team. And I would expect that as the time goes on, they'll be looking at their maintenance spend and trying to figure out how to do that most efficiently. And I would hope that they would view AAR as somebody who can assist them in that regard. We do business today in support of US Air. We do less business in support of American. But we would be optimistic that we'd be able to convince them that we offer competitive solutions for them.
Unknown Analyst:
Are your current maintenance locations conducive to helping them?
David P. Storch:
Well, they have a heavy -- one of their core markets would be the Miami market, and we have a maintenance facility at the Miami Airport. So that would be very conducive. And I think that the wide-body facility we have in Louisiana, although not necessarily right on their network, I think -- I'm certain they have lots of airplanes that fly over that location. So it's not totally inconvenient. It's not perfect because it's probably not on their route network, but it's probably not totally inconvenient. So yes, our facilities, I think, are in a good physical location for their business.
Unknown Analyst:
Okay. Last question, as you've mentioned a large acquisition outside the U.S, can you speak to how you would do that deal relative to your current balance sheet and cash flow?
David P. Storch:
Yes, so a large -- it's going to be meaningful for the supply chain businesses. It wouldn't be a -- it's not a deal-changer kind of large. It's a very affordable opportunity. So I would imagine that we would actually pay for it out of our cash account. And yes, I think -- yes, I think -- yes, that's about it, Stan.
Unknown Analyst:
Okay, last question is your thoughts on increasing operating margin near term or long term.
David P. Storch:
It's a goal of ours. We continue to stay focused around it. This quarter, we struggled a little bit in terms of the gross margins. But you can see we continue to manage our SG&A, and it gave us a slight improvement in operating margins. We didn't have a needle mover. But as we continue to go through the portfolio and assess our different businesses and where we want to put more emphasis, it would be our goal to improve operating margins.
Unknown Analyst:
Okay, so you can see gains in the future?
David P. Storch:
Yes.
Operator:
Our next question is from Donovan Chaney of Wells Fargo.
Donovan Chaney - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division:
Most of my questions have been answered. But did you guys comment yet on your free cash flow goal? I think last quarter, you were targeting free cash flow of about equal to or a little bit greater than net income. Does that -- how does your working capital investment for that new supply chain win or maybe the lower airlift business kind of shrink that? Is that something to think about?
David P. Storch:
Yes, I think free cash flow for the balance of the year will be under a little bit of pressure because we just made this acquisition of the cargo system product line over in Germany, and we have won these recent supply chain deals, which will require capital investment. So our internal goal, up until some of these investments we've made, has been what you've indicated. We -- the second half of the year might be a little bit harder to achieve it. So that will be cash flow from operations. We're still expecting that number to be -- continue to do well, but we might be a little challenged on free cash flow.
Operator:
Our next question is from Julie Yates Stewart of Credit Suisse.
Julie Yates - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division:
Just 2 follow-ups for me. David, on the precision business, would you consider selling this if you can't realize the improvement you're targeting? I would imagine multiples for these types of businesses are pretty attractive, given the positive cycle dynamics and the consolidation we've already seen.
David P. Storch:
So Julie, the answer is yes, we would, but we have to get into the black first. Because if you do it -- if you multiply by a loss, there's no real multiple. So we got to get our act together in the business and we've got the right team on it. And we will get it fixed.
Julie Yates - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division:
Okay. And then second, did you guys look at the airborne systems business that Trans Am acquired?
David P. Storch:
Yes.
Julie Yates - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division:
Okay. Did you get outbid or is it something that you just...
David P. Storch:
No, first of all, I won't comment on it, but we did look at it.
Operator:
There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.
David P. Storch:
Well, thank you very much for your participation today. Hopefully, the call was of value, and I hope you appreciate the color that we provided today. And appreciate your support, and I want to wish everybody a happy and healthy and safe holiday season. Thank you.

Operator:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Fiscal 2014 First Quarter Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our News Release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David P. Storch:
Thank you, sir, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter fiscal 2014 performance. I'm joined at our corporate headquarters with Tim Romenesko, our Chief Operating Officer; and John Fortson, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Sharp, our Chief Accounting Officer and Controller. So here are some of the highlights from the quarter. Sales were $515 million, down 7% from $551 million the first quarter of 2013. As expected, sales in our Technology Products segment were down mostly due to lower levels of activity in our Mobility Systems business. This is partially offset by good performance at the commercial Cargo business. In the Aviation Services segment, sales were down slightly from the prior year as we had lower sales in our supply chain business, which we expect to recover during our second and subsequent quarters. We continue to see good results in our airframe maintenance operations where we are ramping up our Duluth facility and added a third line to meet demand. Further, we have a strong quarter at our Airlift business where we continue to maintain high readiness levels. We're pleased to report that despite lower sales, our operating margin in the quarter was 7.4%, an improvement over the 7% operating margin reported in the first quarter last year. This improvement was the result of our continued focus on cost management and higher operational efficiency across several of our businesses. Net earnings for the quarter was $0.45, equal to last year's diluted earnings per share. In this quarter, it's also important to point out that we continue our focus on cash generation, generating $27.5 million in cash from operations and $20.3 million in free cash flow, which is in excess of our net income. We reduced our net debt by $22 million from May 31, which brings us down $109 million from August 31 last year, and paid dividends of $0.075 per share during the quarter. In the Aviation Services segment, sales were down slightly from last year. Our MRO business continued to perform at high levels of capacity utilization, demand for maintenance services from our customers remains strong, and as previously mentioned, in late August, we added a third line in Duluth. In addition, late in the first quarter, we announced the opening of our sixth North American aircraft MRO facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana. We received a limited authorization from the FAA on August 30 to begin operations at this site, and we are in the FAA's queue to receive full authorization as soon as possible. The facility significantly expands our capacity as it will enable us to handle up to 7 wide- or 10 narrow-body aircraft at a time. And as we sit here today, we have 4 wide-body aircraft in the facility receiving maintenance. During Q1, our Commercial Supply Chain Management business experienced seasonal softness, which we expect to recover throughout the balance of the year, mostly on deferrals and to satisfy supply-demands that are still there but basically will occur in Q2 and beyond. Also subsequent to quarter end, we delivered the first of 2 customized 737 aircraft to the U.S. Marshal Service, and we expect to deliver the second aircraft in a few weeks. Our Airlift business produced strong results in the quarter and continues to maintain high operational readiness levels. In early September, we received preliminary notice of intent from our customer to exercise its option of approximately $100 million of rotary wing contract revenue. As previously discussed, our Airlift business also has $110 million contract covering 12 rotary-wing aircraft expiring on November 30. We believe there are a number of different outcomes for these aircrafts, including extensions on the expiring contracts as well as fulfilling customer requirements on other contracts. I'd like now to turn to our Technology Products segment. As anticipated, sales were down in this segment due to the year-over-year decline in our Mobility business. We expect sales of our Mobility Products business to remain steady going forward and to be neutral to prior year's results for the balance of the fiscal year. Despite the sales decline, the business continues to be a market leader and a profitable contributor to the company's results. In addition, our Commercial Cargo business continues to perform well year-over-year. In closing, we are encouraged with our earnings and operating margin performance in the quarter as the company continued to generate strong cash flow. Sitting here today, we see many high-potential opportunities to grow the core business, both internally and externally. Thank you for your attention and support, and I will now turn the call over to John Fortson.
John C. Fortson:
Thanks, David. I'll provide a bit more color around the financial performance of the company during the first quarter, including comments around interest, cash flow, capital expenditures and capital structure. Mike Sharp and I both will be available after the call to answer any questions that you may have. Revenues in the first quarter were $515 million versus the prior-year level of $551 million. Aviation Services revenue at $394 million was essentially flat to prior year. As David mentioned, our airframe maintenance facilities and Airlift operations continue to perform well and were offset by lower revenues in our Supply Chain business. Technology Products revenue declined 21% quarter-over-quarter to $121 million, driven by the expected decline in demand from mobility products, which saw a $35 million sales decline from last year first quarter. Again, we expect sales of our mobility products business to remain steady going forward and to be neutral to prior-year results for the balance of the fiscal year. Our Commercial Cargo Systems performed well in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit margin in the first quarter was 16.5% compared to 16.4% margin in the prior-year first quarter. As mentioned in our release, margins in Aviation Services segments improved to 16.6%, primarily driven by efficiency improvement in our MRO operations. On the Technology Products side, the decline in margin to 15.9% in this quarter from 19% in the first quarter of last year was primarily driven by the volume decline of mobility products. Moving on, we did a really good job with cost management this quarter, bringing SG&A as a percentage of sales to 9.3% from 9.7% in the prior year quarter. We are attacking costs across the company and are pleased with the progress that we have made. Operating profit at 7.4% for the quarter was 40 basis points better than prior-year quarter. As we've said before, improving our operating profitability is a focus across the company, and we're pleased to see this margin improvement, particularly with the revenue decline versus the prior year. We remain very focused on cash generation. During the first quarter, we generated $27.5 million of cash from operations. We had $7.2 million in capital expenditures and $20.3 million of free cash flow. Net interest expense for the first quarter was $10.7 million, an increase over $10.2 million from the prior year primarily due to our upsized senior notes offering. As mentioned by David, in this quarter, we reduced our net debt by $22 million sequentially and a $109 million over the 12-month period. Depreciation and amortization, including amortization of stock-based compensation, was $21 million during the first quarter. Our first quarter diluted earnings per share is based on 39 million shares in our diluted share count, which is down 2.7 million shares from last year's level. Thank you for your attention and operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Larry Solow from CJS Securities.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Just on the aviation supply, I realize the -- firstly, you had a pretty tough comp last year. I think growth was 13% organic. And I know quarters are -- it's a seasonally slower quarter and you don't guide to the quarter. But did the little bit of the flatness catch you a little bit on surprise, it's all, I guess, in the supply chain? And is that all basically just time, really just a timing issue and...
David P. Storch:
Yes, our view is, first of all, yes, to some degree, we were expecting a stronger quarter. We had a few customers who deferred heavy-engine business, for instance and therefore, pushed off some of the activity into Q2. But we are expecting to recover the shortfall from Q1 into Qs 2, 3 and 4. We also mentioned in our press release, we didn't mention in the conference call script, but we -- and that's just something we missed, but we are reaffirming full year guidance on sales and earnings.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Right. And so I mean, you really haven't -- even in the mix between the 2 segments, hasn't really changed much? Or you still see sort of a basic -- sounds like it's all timing related?
David P. Storch:
Yes, I think there's timing -- I think, Larry, if you look back 2 years ago this quarter, we had sales of about $490 million. So I think last year, we had -- we did have a strong quarter. We had a couple of individual situations that caused that to be. But so we did expect higher sales this summer from our supply chain. But it's not -- we do expect that what we did -- what did get pushed off based on what our customers are telling us, we do expect to recover that business in the out quarters.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay. And I realized it's -- there's some slowness in this time anyhow. Have you seen -- are you seeing orders or activities start to pick up as you get into a little bit seasonally stronger time in the fall?
David P. Storch:
Yes, I mean, I think that we're -- we feel pretty good about how the quarter is starting. And as we've mentioned also, we will be delivering 2 aircraft this quarter. So we are expecting a fairly solid quarter.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
And could you just talk a little bit about Louisiana in terms of scope? Is it sort of -- it sounds like it's similar in size to Indy, I guess, with -- you have more wide-body capabilities. But that and then the second part of the question is sort of how do you expect to ramp sort of over the next couple of years?
David P. Storch:
It's very different than any other facility that we have. So you're dealing with the -- each hangar is capable of handling wide-body aircraft. And the -- we view the capacity increase as approximately 7 wide-body and 10 narrow-body aircraft. We have received provisional authorization from the FAA to do work on the aircraft. They're currently in the hangar, and we're in queue to get the full FAA license. So we're very early in that in our involvement, and it's a little bit hard to predict precisely what the ramp might be. But I would imagine that by a year from now, we'll have a much steadier -- first of all, have much more visibility. And I think we'll have a steady, steady contributing business to our profitability. So we only received the provisional certification on August 30. So we're not even a month into the -- into having the operation. We have over 100 mechanics, and we are doing work on 4 customer aircraft. And we are today looking to hire more mechanics and hopefully, we have a fully operational business by the end of the calendar year.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay. And then just the last question on the SG&A. You did a great job at bringing down costs, actually especially considering you're in a down sales environment, you're seeing improved leverage. Is some of that somewhat discretionary and timing related as well? Or is that...
David P. Storch:
Some are structural in nature and some -- keep in mind, last year, we were operating more facilities. We closed a couple of facilities last year. So some are structural in nature and -- but the preponderance of savings is around a sharp focus around spend. So we're watching travel, we're watching freight, we're watching office supplies, shop supplies, and we're looking at the critical materials that go into some of our manufacturing businesses. So I think it's pretty much across the board, and we're -- I believe the effort is gaining momentum.
Operator:
And our next question comes from Julie Yates from Crédit Suisse.
Julie Yates - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division:
David, it looks like if you maintain this level of profitability, you'd be well ahead of the guidance that you're reaffirming today. So can you help us just kind of understand, is this conservatism? Or are there other puts and takes later on in the year that I'm not factoring in?
David P. Storch:
Well, I think we always -- we prefer to be under committed and over delivered. And I think it's our preferred approach. So yes, I mean, I think we feel that we're giving the appropriate guidance based on what we know, and we hope that we perform well against that guidance and exceed it where we can.
Julie Yates - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division:
Okay. And then was the Technology Products business, was it a little bit weaker than you had anticipated? Because I think last quarter, you said that you had expected that it had leveled out?
David P. Storch:
No, no, no. We had indicated that we had at least 1 or 2 more quarters. And we anticipate that we -- that we pretty well level out at the end of this -- at the period we just ended. So we don't anticipate much more in the way of decline, very minor decline in Q2, which would be better than what we had previously communicated.
Julie Yates - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division:
Okay. And then just with all the news on -- out of the Air Force on KC-10 and the risk around that fleet being scrapped with -- in sequestration, can you help us think about -- I know the flight hour contract is at 0% margin, but can you help us just think about the risk for you guys there?
David P. Storch:
I think if the Air Force goes the route of taking the KC-10 fleet down, they will do that as they take on new KC-46s I believe the number is. And so at least that's the way it's been explained to us by Northrop Grumman. Of course, those deliveries don't start out, I think, into what, '15 or '16, and there's a few a year. And by the time these aircraft are out of service, our contract will have expired.
Operator:
And our next question comes from Tyler Hojo from Sidoti & Company.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Just firstly, I was just wondering, perhaps, if you could quantify what the impact was in the quarter just from some of the deferred heavy-engine visits that you were referring to. Would commercial sales volumes, perhaps, been flat year-on-year if not for that? Just trying to put some context around that.
David P. Storch:
Yes, we're just trying to answer your question. Again we'll have to do the math to figure it out. But I'd say that, that if we would have had the sales that we were expecting, we would have at least had flat commercial sales. But I think maybe...
John C. Fortson:
It would've been actually...
David P. Storch:
No, actually commercial sales, we just checked, commercial sales would've been stronger had the -- had what you mentioned happened.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Really? Okay. So talking about a pretty significant amount of work.
David P. Storch:
Well, keep in mind, the decline was relatively modest. So the decline is less than -- right around 1%, a little bit over 1%. So the sales that got deferred, had those sales happened, had we hit those targets, then we would've exceeded -- we would've had commercial sales growth, yes.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Okay. Understood. Thanks for the clarification. And then just in regards to the guidance range, I'm just curious what you all are anticipating in terms of future contribution from joint venture income? I think it was about $1 million in the quarter.
Michael J. Sharp:
Tyler, this is Mike. That amount going forward is going to be reasonably modest. It's not going to be any more -- it should not -- we don't expect it to be any more than that amount in Q2, 3 and 4. So relatively modest number.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Okay. And then just in context with that, maybe you could provide us an update with kind of where we stand with the owned and co-owned aircraft portfolio?
Michael J. Sharp:
There's no difference in our aircraft portfolio from year end. We have, I think, 4 aircraft owned in joint venture and then 2 aircraft in our wholly-owned portfolio.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Okay. Great. Just a couple of other ones here. You mentioned in regards to the Airlift contract that is still outstanding, I think it's $110 million, that that's coming up, I think, in November. When would you expect to come to an agreement with your customer? Would it be sometime soon? Or would it, perhaps, stretch all the way to kind of the expiration of the contract that you currently have?
David P. Storch:
I think we'll have some knowledge next week. We're expecting some knowledge next week. But there's a lot of shuffling, if you will, in terms of different possibilities and outcomes. So we're in touch with the 4-star levels, and I think there's a little bit of -- I think they're trying to move things around and aren't really ready right at this moment to commit. But we anticipate some commitments as early as next week.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Okay. That's great. And David, in the past, you've discussed kind of the desire, I guess, to ultimately move some of your Airlift assets outside of Afghanistan. Could you maybe talk about the pipeline there? Or are things kind of robust enough where you don't really need to worry about that anymore?
David P. Storch:
Well, I think we still like to have a better balance to our fleet. So we still do worry about it and think about it, and we are offering assets into other markets. So yes, we continue to work that pretty actively. And I would say that the deal pipeline in both regards, in the currency other as well as some -- other markets, is fairly brisk at this moment. But there is a fair amount of uncertainty coming from the customer in terms of what their actual requirements might be.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Okay. So how would it work for you guys? Would you wait until you hear what the requirement is before you look to place additional aircraft outside of Afghanistan? Or would you be willing to essentially buy additional Airlift capability to fulfill additional contract?
David P. Storch:
We may not buy. We may lease, or we may figure out another way to get -- to use that customer equipment, et cetera. So we're looking at a few different possibilities.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Okay. Great. And just lastly for me, I was wondering if you could provide us some guidance just in regards to CapEx and free cash flow for the year.
Michael J. Sharp:
Tyler, I mean, I think you should think about our CapEx -- so we had a little over $7 million this quarter, sort of in that $30 million to $40 million range for the year, notwithstanding anything unusual. I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question?
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Just free cash flow.
Michael J. Sharp:
On the free cash flow front, I mean, what we've talked about fairly consistently over the last 12 months is identifying as our target free cash flow equal to our net income, and we've delivered on that. We've exceeded that in the last several quarters. So I think the way to think about that is equal to our net income.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jon Braatz from Kansas City Capital.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
Going back to Louisiana, given the lease payments and so on and the amount of volume you're running through that facility, is that a little bit of a drain on your profitability early on here?
David P. Storch:
Very minor. But yes, I mean, it's more of a drain at this moment than a contributor.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
Okay, but not really significant.
David P. Storch:
No, not really significant.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
Okay. And then secondly, let's move forward, let's say 9 months, and you've done a good job of generating free cash and paying down debt. And let's say you get to a point where you paid off another $75 million or something like that, would your focus return continue to be on free cash and debt repayment? Or would you be more inclined to shift a little bit and think about acquisitions and purchases? Or would you just continue to focus on debt repayment?
David P. Storch:
So Jon, I think that there's kind of -- part of our thinking today is kind of looking a little bit more externally towards investments in deals. We're also looking at investing in program activity to support some of our supply chain initiatives. So I think the free cash flow picture could change as a result of 1 or 2 of these events occurring. But in the meantime, we continue to drive the existing businesses to generate as much cash flow from operations as they can. And that energy will continue, and hopefully we'll be able to find good places to invest some of this capital we've been generating.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
Do you think that could be more of a...
David P. Storch:
We're focused on EBITDA, the total to net debt. And I think we're making a nice dent in that and get that ratio right, and then we'll be kind of more apt to get more aggressive externally.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
Do you think that could be -- would that be more of a fiscal '15 possibility, or still something happening this fiscal year?
David P. Storch:
I think it might -- yes, it's possible you'll see some stuff happening in '14.
Operator:
Our next question comes from J.B. Groh from D.A. Davidson.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
I apologize if you've covered this, but could you give us the utilization rate in MRO in the quarter?
David P. Storch:
In terms of hangar capacity?
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
Yes, yes. How many slots are full, that kind of a thing.
Michael J. Sharp:
Just kind of in general, it was a reasonably strong quarter for the MRO. During the summer, the inputs are always a little bit lighter, but they perform very well. We -- as we go into the balance of the fiscal year, the story gets a little bit tighter. But I'd say the first quarter was normal. We had some capacity. But we're able to flex the workforce, things like that, to adjust for it. So...
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
Right. So there's the normal seasonality, but maybe if you're not willing to put out a number, I understand. But could you maybe talk about how it trended versus last quarter -- or I mean, last year rather.
Michael J. Sharp:
Yes, no, it's positive in terms of the number of hours produced across the facilities.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
And then when you look into, say, Q2 where on a seasonal basis you'd be busier, how do the kind of advanced bookings look relative to what you did last year?
Michael J. Sharp:
They look strong.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
So up?
Michael J. Sharp:
Yes.
Operator:
And our next question comes from Stan Mann from Mann Family Investments. We do have a follow-up question from Julie Yates from Crédit Suisse.
Julie Yates - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division:
Can you guys disclose what the growth was in commercial and defense? Just the organic growth by end market?
Michael J. Sharp:
Julie, the sales -- there was a sales decline in defense right around 7%, and the sales decline in commercial was right around 6%.
Julie Yates - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division:
Okay. And do you have those figures for the full year '13 as well?
Michael J. Sharp:
I mean, not at my fingertips.
David P. Storch:
Yes, commercial, I believe, was up 19% -- 16% -- 14%. Commercial was up 14%, and defense was down 10%.
Operator:
And we have a follow-up question from Larry Solow from CJS Securities.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Could you just update us on the Precision Manufacturing business? I know it's had a couple hiccups over the last few quarters. I think one last quarter. Any update on that?
Michael J. Sharp:
So we continue to work through and address our issues there. And we feel like going into the second quarter, our performance will be significantly better than the first quarter and the last -- actually the last few quarters. So I think we're making progress on it, Larry, and I think, like I said, I think this quarter, we should start to see some meaningful results from our efforts.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay. Just on Louisiana, I mean, I don't know how you can answer this, but it seems like it'll be a pretty modest negative impact early on. And maybe for the full year, not a huge impact positively. But is it -- so is it fair to say sort of a pre-breakeven, maybe slight positive for the year?
David P. Storch:
I'd be disappointed if it's not positive.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] And I'm showing no one in the queue at this time. I'd like to hand the conference back over for any closing remarks.
David P. Storch:
Well, thank you for your participation and look forward to our next call in 90 days. Thank you.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program for today. You may all this disconnect, and have a wonderful day."

Operator:
Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the AAR Corp. Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call Mr. Chris Mason, Director of Corporate Communications. You may begin, sir.
Chris Mason:
Thank you, Kevin. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and year end earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for fiscal year ended May 31, 2012. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Storch.
David P. Storch:
Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today to discuss what has been an excellent year for AAR. I'm joined in our boardroom by Tim Romenesko, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Sharp, our acting Chief Financial Officer. I am also very pleased to have our incoming Chief Financial Officer, John Fortson in the room with us here today. As you know, John joins us from Merrill Lynch, where he was the head of the bank's Global Capital Goods sector. Over the years, John interacted with the company over the last nine years and has a good familiarization with the business and the company and the challenges and the opportunities. And we're very excited to have John join our team. I'd also like to note that in terms of leadership experience, prior to his finance career, John was a company commander in the 82nd Airborne and is a West Point graduate. We're excited to the strength and experience he brings to our team. And John will assume the CFO responsibilities effective tomorrow. I'd also like to thank Mike Sharp for the job he did, acting as CFO over the past 10 years. Mike has been with the company for quite some time and will continue on with the company as our Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller. So moving along, here are some of the highlights from the quarter. Sales were $554 million. This solid performance was driven by continued strength in our commercial aviation businesses, including our MRO operations and Telair. Further, although we saw defense-related softness in certain areas, we continue to see strong results from our Airlift business, even with no additional aircraft or contracts being added during the year. Operating income in the quarter adjusted for a charge on the KC-10 program that Mike will give you more details about in a few minutes, grew to $39 million. And adjusted net earnings for the quarter was $0.50 per share, up nicely compared to $0.45 per share last year. And for the full year, sales were $2.14 billion, an increase of 3.5%. We grew adjusted operating income by 5.9% to $152.4 million and we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.85. As we look back at the year, it's important to point out that we also generated $125 million of free cash flow, allowing us to reduce our net debt position by $91 million. We retired the 1.75% convertible notes, which also reduced the number of shares used in our diluted share count by 3.4 million shares. We bought back nearly 1 million shares of common stock in average price of $14.90. We paid out $0.30 per share in dividend. And we also refinanced the portion of our revolver debt, locking in at a low interest rate. As you can see, we are working to pull all of the appropriate levers that create value for our shareholders. We're pleased with what we accomplished, both in the quarter and in the year. So if I may, Aviation Services, our segments performed well in the fourth quarter with sales up 7% versus prior year. I want to recognize -- I want to take a moment if I could and recognize the incredible work that our employees at our Airlift business are doing on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan and other locations. This is not easy work and these teammates are performing brilliantly. They have demonstrated exceptional levels of reliability and performance. Airlift revenues grew by 28% this year, strictly due to outstanding operational performance and high levels of readiness. We were pleased that the U.S. transportation command awarded as an option year, expense of $98 million for our fixed wing aircraft. This covers a meaningful portion of our revenue expectation for the year ahead, and in general, demand remains strong. We remain confident that our operational readiness will continue at high levels in the coming year. When we bought this business in 2010, we saw a long-term demand for this type of capability. Early on, we faced certain challenges transitioning the business. And over the past year, we made great progress exceeding our operational plan and positioning the company for the future. In MRO, I'd like to share with you that we had very strong fourth quarter, an excellent year, and this continues to be a growth business for the company. To update you on our operations, we have facilities in Indianapolis, Miami, Oklahoma City and Hot Springs. And in this fiscal year, we added Duluth. We delivered close to five million man-hours of work this year, which in essence is showing steady growth over our prior year. We continue driving efficiencies on our operations. And as a result, we are seeing improvements in margins. We have a strong position in the U.S. domestic narrow-body market, and now we are looking for opportunities to serve the wide-body market as well as to see if we can grow our footprint internationally. Very pleased with the progress we've made operationally. We've caught the notice of people, not just here in the States, but also around the globe, and this is creating opportunities for the company that in the past we didn't necessarily see. Our commercial supply chain management park support business had a solid quarter. We see steady demand for our products on the commercial side, and our view is that spares market remains fundamentally healthy and is expected to pick up over the next several months. And as many of you know, who have been following the company for quite some time, we have a really good leadership position in this market. And our view is that there's tremendous opportunities for us to go ahead and pivot off of our current position and see steady growth and some really exciting stuff happening in that business over the next year in front of us. We did see some weakness on our Defense Logistics business, largely due to the falloff in activity in the KC-10 program. Mike will give you the details, but as a result of adjusting our forecast to reflect lower flying activity, we incurred a $19.5 million after-tax charge in the quarter. Flight hours on the KC-10 program have been at historically low levels. We are, however, continuing to seek ways to improve the economics of this program. In the fourth quarter we delivered one of two specially-modified aircraft to the Colombian Air Force, that we discussed during our last call. The second aircraft has been delivered in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. This project is a great example of a complex undertaking that brought us together over eight different teams within AAR and is representative of our unique and integrated capabilities. As an additional piece of good news, we announced yesterday an award to deliver two customized 737 aircrafts to the U.S. Marshals Service. In both these instances, these were aircraft that we went on to the market procured, we managed the aircraft through overhauls and conversions, and we manage the engine overhauls, landing gear overhauls, et cetera. So I think it's a good example of the capability that AAR has, and in both regards these are defense and government related customers looking for lower-cost solutions. In Technology Products, we've had good results. We continue to see good results from the acquisition of Telair and Nordisk. And of course those gives us a lot more exposure in this sector towards the commercial markets. But overall, this past year has been a challenging one, given the pressure on defense budgets, and its impact, specifically on our mobility business. We had a significant decline in revenues as we had forecasted during this period in mobility, and yet we were able to go ahead and still have a -- I might add that even though they've had a significant reduction in revenues, they still are running a profitable business with decent margins. Telair showed improvement and finished the year with a particularly strong quarter if we look at it on year-over-year basis. And at Nordisk, we're in the process of introducing some new products, one of which is around fire contamination and elimination with a venture that we have with our partner, DuPont. In closing, as we move along our new fiscal year, we will continue to focus on execution. We'll look for ways to grow our business, to improve our margins, and we'll remain focused on cash generation, something that we're very proud of as you review this year's results. And the goal is to provide superior products and services to our clients and to deliver overall value to our shareholders. So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike and fill you in on some of the financial details.
Michael Sharp:
Okay, thanks, David. I will now provide a bit more color around the financial performance of the company during the fourth quarter, including comments around interest, cash flow, capital expenditures and capital structure. John and I will both be available the rest of the day to answer any questions that you may have. As David mentioned, revenues in the fourth quarter were $554 million versus the prior-year level of $563 million. Aviation Services revenue grew 7% to $417 million, driven by strong performance at Airlift and in our airframe maintenance facilities, offset slightly by lower revenues and aftermarket support for our defense customers. Our airframe maintenance facilities continue to perform well and at high-capacity utilization. Our Duluth facility is up and running with two lines, and expected to go to a third line in September. Technology Products revenue declined 21% year-over-year to $137 million, driven largely by the expected decline in demand for mobility products, which saw a $47 million sales decline in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This was positively offset by strength, as David mentioned, in Commercial Cargo systems, which rebounded in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was 10.9% and includes the KC-10 related charge. As you know, we are currently in the middle of a multi-year support program, teaming with Northrop Grumman to support the Air Force's fleet of KC-10 aircraft. Our primary responsibilities include inventory management and repairs of critical components. The contract has two primary revenue streams
David P. Storch:
Thanks, Mike. Let me conclude with our guidance for fiscal year 2014. As stated in our press release today, we currently expect 2014 consolidated sales in the range of $2.175 billion to $2.225 billion. In Aviation Services we expect to see continued strength in our supply chain and MRO repair businesses. We also expect our Airlift business to continue to perform well as we work towards identifying and capturing additional market opportunities. In our Technology Products business, we expect to see revenue stability in the defense environment that remains under pressure. We believe our Mobility Products business, which was a major source of pressure in fiscal 2013, has leveled off. Our major initiatives in the segment are focused on operating efficiencies and innovation in lightweight solutions. Across the company, we intend to continue to drive improvement in our operating margin. As a result, we are currently guiding for a full year diluted earnings per share in the range of $2 to $2.05. Thank -- at this time, I would like to thank you for your participation and listening to our update. And we're now open for any questions you might have.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
David, I was wondering or Tim or whoever, just can give us sort of a read on the aviation market in general sort of where your customers stand, where you think -- sort of your pulse as we stand today?
David P. Storch:
Yes. We feel pretty good about commercial markets. We think we had a good year. We have a fair amount of initiatives underway. We have more visibility and opportunities than we've had in the past. So yes, I think that the commercial markets look okay.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Sort of, things -- sort of capacity wise, and load factors, it seems like things are sort of slowly ticking up, is that fair to say?
David P. Storch:
Yes. Our sense is that our customers are doing well. And that -- they're looking at a lot of different things. They're looking at a lot of -- it's a lot of moving pieces. You have the Delta taking on the Southwest aircraft, the 717. You have our building up of our people count, if you will, in Duluth, so we can handle more work up there. Yes, I -- our international business opportunity pool looks pretty strong. So I'd say, all in all, our distribution business has done well. We didn't really disclose much -- talk about Unison, but our Unison distribution business is very strong, very -- double-digit growth on a year-over-year basis. So, yes, I think we got a lot of good stuff going on. The MRO shops are full. It's pretty busy. Of course it's summer time, so they're a little less full than they've been in other parts of the year. But on a year-over-year basis, they're fairly strong. We continue to seek out engineering service opportunities, but the demand is there. There's few situations that we're competing for that we hope to win. So, yes, I'd say the feel is pretty good on the commercial side.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Just two thoughts. The Unison deal, I think when you signed that it was supposed to ramp and inevitably reach sort of, I think, $600 million plus or minus over 10 years. Is it sort of reaching its $60 plus million potential sales?
David P. Storch:
Not quite there this year. I think that we should start hitting that target this year, we're coming up to in the following year. But we do have nice progress from year one to year two. And we would expect that -- there's no reason to believe that progress won't continue into year three and on to year four.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Could you just remind be on the Colombian Air Force, I think you probably discussed the last quarter. What's the general -- what was the impact on the P&L, and with the sale -- the deal you announced yesterday be similar?
David P. Storch:
Yes. The -- so the Colombian deal was -- we took two commercial aircraft and converted one into a freighter -- full-freighter and we converted 1 into a combi, which is part freighter, part passenger. We delivered the first aircraft in Q4. It had a -- not a significant impact on earnings. It had good impact on cash because we utilized some assets that we had in stock to go on the air -- to fit on to the aircraft. And so we converted some inventory into cash, but we fell out of margins. So it was still a profitable transaction. It contributed to the quarter's results. And then, the second aircraft delivered this month -- earlier this month to the customer and had a little bit better margin than the first aircraft. And, yes, I think it was a good transaction for the company -- we've also received some follow-on business and we have a reason to believe that there may be more business opportunities to the company with the customer. They're very pleased with the product. They showcased both aircraft at their airshow on July 11 this month. And the aircraft will be on show at a Chilean airshow in March next year.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay just last question, just on free cash flow, which was ridiculously good this year. I mean is that over $3 a share versus $1.80 or whatever and EPs, is that sort of -- I imagine not quite sustainable, but how should we look at that as we go out?
Michael Sharp:
This is a very critical component for us, so we're working very hard. Compensation plans are tied to cash flow generation, so the business is very focused on turning lazy assets into cash, as well as generating better margins and better throughput. So hard for me to quantify precisely if we get to the same level, but I think directionally we'll be in the same ZIP code. We will not have the same kind of yo-yo effect that we've had in prior years when we've had successful cash generation. We believe this cash flow will be steady. Will it be exactly these levels, Larry? Maybe not, but they'll -- they will be solid -- you should see solid cash flow numbers coming from the company this year.
Operator:
Our next question comes from J. B. Groh with DA Davidson.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
I had a question on your realignment of the KC-10 business. I know you've baked in $45 million at 0% margin. Is there any potential upside to that, if you can work on some costs?
David P. Storch:
Yes. The upside will be in the flight hours. So we've taken our conservative look at the flight hours as a result of what we've experienced the last six months. And -- so we've forecast -- we're forecasting fairly low aircraft utilization. And our revenue from the flight hours comes through the utilization, or the number of flight hours that they operate. So we have mild in very low hours. If we get a pickup as a result of the movement of assets away from Afghanistan, or if there's a buildup in Syria or place like -- or something like that, then we would expect the business to be more profitable than the 0% that we now have baked in.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
But has the customer told you any reason why the flight hour numbers are down so significantly?
David P. Storch:
No. The customer has not divulged because, first of all, our customer is Northrop Grumman. Northrop Grumman's customer is the Air Force. We have had indirect contact with the Air Force, but most of contact is directly through Northrop, and they do not have visibility precisely as to why or visibility as to what we should be expecting. Now what we've done is we've looked at the flight hours going back since 1998, and that's as far back as we can get records. And we have been forecasting average usage in the fleet. And we've been a little bit disappointed or surprised that the actual usage, which is at this historical low level. So we think we took a prudent action at this point in time. And if the flight hours resume to historical levels, then this will be -- this segment of the contract will be -- once again, will be profitable.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
Okay. And then on -- you mentioned a pretty decent results in Airlift, and it sounds like you perhaps picked up some share there. Is that correct?
David P. Storch:
No. I think what we've seen is we've operated the aircraft much more efficiently than we have in the past. So you may recall, JB, when we bought this business, we felt there was about $25 million of income on the table that could be assumed once we were able to put certain disciplines in place and the keep the aircraft operationally ready. And the team, led by Randy Martin, has done a remarkable job this past year in having those aircraft in a ready position. So the growth that we've had is really -- actually with fewer aircraft in theater, we've had a significant growth in sales and in income coming from that business.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
So just better utilization and asset management is what you're saying?
David P. Storch:
Absolutely. We've actually freed up some assets that we can possibly apply elsewhere, or if not sell.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
But with all the talk of the drawdown, that sort of thing, is that market still -- I mean is it growing in terms of more outsourcing and more potential bid activity?
David P. Storch:
There's additional demand. Actually, as we sit here today, there's a demand that's been identified in Afghanistan. So there is an RFP that's on the street to support the Afghan nationals. So we are -- we're in there with a bid and hopefully we'll have news in the next few weeks. Other than that, we are looking for other places where we can get utilization and take some market share there -- as we've talked about before, there is a pretty broad and varied application for this kind of capability across different government entities. And it would be our intention to go ahead and compete and capture some of that business.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
Maybe guys, you can give us a portfolio update in terms of the owned aircraft and the ones that are in the JV.
David P. Storch:
Are we talking about the aircraft leasing portfolio now?
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
Yes, yes.
David P. Storch:
Mike?
Michael Sharp:
JV, there's six aircraft in total. Two of the aircraft are wholly-owned and there are four aircraft that are owned under joint venture.
David P. Storch:
JB, also keep in mind now, these aircraft that we've been talking about that we traded here with U.S. Marshal service and with the Colombians, were aircraft that we did not own before we made these transactions. So these are not -- these aircraft did not come from our inventory. They were aircraft that we sourced, purchased, fixed, and then in some cases modified, and then sold.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
Great. And then lastly, Mike, could you maybe give us what's embedded in your 2014 outlook in terms of a tax rate and interest expense?
Michael Sharp:
So for the tax rate, we're thinking in the 34% to 35% range, which is where we historically have been, notwithstanding some of the benefits that we've had from some of the state tax planning strategies we've incorporated over the last couple of years. In terms of interest, it's fairly steady with the fourth quarter interest levels.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
Okay, so about 9%, 6% net?
Michael Sharp:
Maybe slightly higher.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Jon Braatz with Kansas City Capital.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
David, can you talk a little bit about the A400 program? I think the plane started flying. Do you expect any revenue from that program this year?
David P. Storch:
Yes. We should have revenue. We could have revenue as early as Q1, but we will have that revenue in Q2. The program, as you said, is very -- they're very close. They have not delivered the first aircraft, which is MSN 7 to the French Air Force yet, but they are planning to do that pretty much any day now. And it should happen before this month is out actually. So, yes, we've made a lot of progress on that program.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
I think the program has shrunk from the original size. And you've capitalized a lot of costs associated with that program. Is there any risk that those, that you might have to write-off some of those costs? Or how are you going to -- how is that going to be reflected in the revenues coming upstream?
David P. Storch:
Yes. So as we see it now, based on the price that we have per system, we did have a renegotiation with Airbus that we completed here recently. In that renegotiation, we have identified kind of scope of work that we will now be doing, which is slightly less than the original slope -- scope. And then we have a pricing, which is very similar to the pricing we have for the full scope. We anticipate that over the life of the program, we will recover our investment through the selling price that we have. We also will have spare sales. We've had some already. We had some that went into Q4. And we anticipate additional spare sales throughout the fiscal year.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
Well since you capitalize a lot of these costs, I guess the cash flow from any revenue would be rather significant.
David P. Storch:
Yes, that's correct. Yes, you should expect solid cash flow as we sell A400M systems correct.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
Okay. On the Airlift business, how many -- how much of the portfolio is sort of booked for this year? And how many may come off contract?
David P. Storch:
The fixed wing are booked all the way through. A very large percentage of fixed wing are booked all the way through May of next year, so May of '14. There are the -- the rotary wing contract, one contract expires in November and one contract is up for an option year in October. We have a high level of confidence that a large percentage of those assets, even the ones that come off contract, will be transferred over to the contract that still has option years remaining, at least that's our intel as we sit here today.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
How many rotary aircraft do you have?
David P. Storch:
22? There is -- I should know it, 19, 2 and 2. So 24.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
And so only one...
David P. Storch:
24 in Afghanistan, approximately, okay? We can get you the exact number.
Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates:
No, that's fine. So -- but only one comes off-contract in November and there's one with an option. So basically, 22 solid?
David P. Storch:
No one contract. The contracts are for multiple aircraft. We have it laid out in our 10-K, and we can get you that data here very easily, I just don't have it right at this minute.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Doug Carlson with Bank of America.
Doug Carlson:
If you could just give us some kind of broad color on the Middle East and kind of what the demand picture looks like there. I think you've done a great job navigating that area. A little color on that would be my first question.
David P. Storch:
Well, let's see. I mean, Middle East is -- in terms of the -- we've opened up an office in Abu Dhabi to capture more commercial business in the Middle East. So where my head is kind of going in the Middle East right now is to try to figure out how we take advantage of their order book and be in a position to support their growing fleets. So that's the first thing that comes to mind when I think Middle East. Secondly, of course, is Middle East as it relates to U.S. activity. Today we do virtually no business in support of the State Department in Iraq, although there are certain opportunities to do business in support of that customer, we are not currently participating. If we think of Afghanistan as the Middle East, we have a significant presence there with our Airlift operation. Our mobility business, which in the past has supported U.S. operations in moving supplies into that, the other has been softened by the reduction in activity. And then we have recently won a contract supporting the Saudi Arabia -- an effort in Saudi Arabia, where we've -- our C4I business is providing some integration work, as is our container -- our mobility business providing some shelter. So I believe that the Middle East continues to be an area of opportunity for the company. We've invested by opening up an office, as I indicated, in Abu Dhabi. We're staffing that office with one of our senior marketing types and we've had some good success. I might add also that, that office is also handling our activities in Africa. And we have had some success, most notably in Kenya. But we're also touching other potential customers in the Africa region. So for this company, that territory from a commercial vantage point has been relatively negligible in terms of results. And we have some optimism that that will be a productive region for the company.
Doug Carlson:
Excellent. And I guess moving to technology kind of segment, it looks like you expect it to stabilize next year. I mean what's driving that improvement?
David P. Storch:
Well, I don't think it's improvement as much as we don't think there's going to be a lot more decay. So we think we've -- the major piece -- you got two major pieces in that sector. You have the Mobility business, which historically has been AAR's strongest piece of its technology business. And that business has suffered from reductions in activity in support of the U.S. government movement of troops and supplies. I think Mike indicated on a year-over-year basis, we have a revenue decline of $47 million. But I did also indicate that that's been a profit -- continues to be a profitable business. But our carrier and our commercial Cargo Systems businesses is relatively strong -- it's strong. We're on some very good platforms. We continue to support virtually all Airbus-manufactured aircraft. And we have a position on the 747-8 aircraft. So we think the commercial cargo business is decent. Is it gangbusters? No, but its decent. And then we have, as we alluded to from the last questioner, we will start making deliveries of A400M cargoes this year. And those are approximately $1.5 million per unit.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stan Manny with Manny's Family Investment.
Unknown Analyst:
Two basic questions. One, where do you envision is the growth opportunities for 2014 and beyond?
David P. Storch:
Stan, I think you'll see continued growth in our commercial activities, so I think you'll see some -- you'll see growth in our spares business and our logistics -- spares and logistics. You'll see growth in our MRO activities. And you'll see growth in our -- you should see growth in our commercial cargo systems arena. So I think you'll see some new programs. You'll see some new wins, I believe. And so you'll see, I think, continued progress in the commercial space. I think on the defense side, we've had some success here recently creating some of these unique aircraft solutions for customers. And we continue to kind of canvas the world to see who else might be interested in that kind of lower cost solution. And whether we can close something and deliver within the next fiscal -- this next fiscal year or not, might be a question. But I do believe that we will have continued success doing that kind of activity. So, yes I think you'll see good growth out of commercial markets. Our defense markets business should hold its own, notwithstanding any other dramatic cuts to budgets. And yes, I think that's where you'll see the action.
Unknown Analyst:
Two -- one question that's an add on to this. The American merger or takeover, do you see that as a near-term opportunity in your maintenance business?
David P. Storch:
Well, the maintenance business -- as we sit here today on this call, we have a capacity problem, right? Because we don't have a lot more space. We have some space we can accommodate some additional demand, but we couldn't accommodate a dramatic requirement as we sit here today. Now we're thinking about how we deal with that and we're trying to create -- we're trying to open up some space, so to speak. But at this moment as we sit here today, it would be hard for us to digest meaningful slug of airframe business. Now, we will -- we do think that we have a better shot at improving some of the component activity. We have -- American has not been a significant customer for the company over the years. US Air, we've had decent relationships with US Air. We do landing gear repairs, we do component repairs. We sell them some parts. So as they -- as the two businesses merge, and as the U.S. Air leadership moves into a more prominent role and a merged entity, we think that there'll be some opportunities for the company. I can't comment on the duration -- when you're talking about short term -- we're not baking in any short-term pickups -- meaningful pickups. But I think longer term, I think it bodes well for the company.
Unknown Analyst:
Okay. My last question is, one I ask all the time. You have a gigantic amount of free cash flow. So can you give us your vision or priorities, whether it would be buyback, a new acquisition, pay down a debt -- could you kind of flesh that out for us please?
David P. Storch:
Yes. I think that there are a few different parameters that go into that decision. So when you look at last year, we generated a significant amount of cash. We used some of that to pay down our debt, so we feel very pleased with the improvement in our debt to equity position. We used some of that to pay down -- to buy in stock. And so if you see the average purchase price of our stock, 1 million shares at $14.19 a share. And then we took some of the cash and we invested it back in the business. And I think as we look forward, I think there'll be a combination -- we'll apply to capital. We still have -- we have about $35 million remaining on our authorization from the board to purchasing shares. I think that's probably -- that's an option. I believe continuing to pay down debt is important to us. I think we'll probably, at some point in time, take a look at the board level, take a look at the dividend and see how we feel about that. And I think, obviously, returning capital and giving our shareholders a good return on their capital is important to us. So we will continue to explore all these things. Acquisitions are also in the mix as well. So, there a few different things that we're looking at, that fit in strategically very well with what we're doing. And we may be in the position to pull the trigger there. As we sit here today in the month of July, we had a very good cash generation. A good month in June. Our net debt position has improved from year end at $91 million improvement in net debt. We knocked off another $40 million of debt improvement. So when you look at June of '12 versus June of '13 our net debt is down $130 million. So we will continue to focus on all the different places we can put -- we can use the capital.
Unknown Analyst:
Okay. As you're sitting here today, looking at the -- what's available on the acquisition front, because your free cash flow seems to be better than many of your comparable competitors. Do you see any near-term acquisitions as possible -- good possibilities?
David P. Storch:
Stan, I'd rather not comment on that, if you don't mind. I believe that we will continue to look for good deals as they present themselves. I think I indicated some of the objectives that we have for the year. So if opportunities present themselves that match up with things that we're trying to do, then we may pull the trigger.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Just a couple of follow-ups. The interest rate assumption, or the interest expense assumed to be basically flat from this quarter. But does that assume then that you don't pay down new debt? Or it's just sort of -- just sort curious how that works out.
David P. Storch:
Well we've got, Larry, we've got some converts that mature. Well there's -- converts that mature, I think in February -- late February, early March, so that comes out later on in the year.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay.
David P. Storch:
No. But Larry, I think you're looking at it correctly.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
That's fine. David, just in terms of the Airlift business, the sort of the big concern is what happens after Afghanistan or -- and I believe you have a lot of options. But do you see Afghanistan really, not from your sake, but just on the macro level, do you see Afghanistan's needs or demand for Airlift dropping significantly in the next year? Or do you think this can go beyond 2014?
David P. Storch:
I'd be surprised if it doesn't go beyond 2014.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Right. Okay. So there's a good chance that you may -- not that you're not looking for opportunities, but you may still be significantly there in '15?
David P. Storch:
Yes.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay. Last -- just a housekeeping question. The charge -- the $29.8 million debt all go into gross margin -- was that all cost of goods, or was there some -- would there be piece of that go somewhere else?
Michael Sharp:
You know it's interesting Larry. It does all impact gross profit. There was a portion of it that we were required to reduce revenues. And then the rest of it went to cost of sales. But the important part is that it all impacts gross profit.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
So I guess just simple math, you can't add that back to gross margin, because I didn't get a little higher gross margin than what you guys said. Is that right? Am I doing -- I can't do that?
Michael Sharp:
Right. Because there was a -- when you adjust for the impact that the sales would have been a little higher, so I think that's why you're probably off.
Operator:
And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our host for closing comments.
David P. Storch:
Well, thank you, everybody, for participating today. Once again we're very proud of the year that we just ended and we're excited about the year that we're about to enter. Thank you so much.

Operator:
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AAR Corp. Third Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce our host for today, Mr. Chris Mason, Director of Corporate Communications. Sir, please go ahead.
Chris Mason:
Thank you, Karen, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AAR's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made this afternoon may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as noted in our news release and the risk factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2012. In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman and CEO, David Storch.
David P. Storch:
Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results, which in general was another solid quarter. With me today, in beautiful Chicago, is Tim Romenesko, our President, Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Sharp, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to start with some of the major financial highlights. Consolidated sales in the quarter were $520 million, which is down slightly 2.6% compared to the prior year. Similar to our second quarter, we saw continued positive trends in the commercial aftermarket and solid performance at Airlift, offset by reduced sales at our Mobility Products unit. Consolidated operating margins in the quarter were 7.2%, which compares favorably to last year's margin of 6.7%. We expect to continue to drive margin improvement in the fourth quarter. Earnings per share in the third quarter were $0.46, which compares favorably with last year's result of $0.41 when you adjust for the tax benefit of $0.09 that was recorded last year during the third quarter. We generated strong cash flow in the quarter and continued use of cash to reduce debt and provide value to our shareholders. Since the end of February last year, we reduced net debt by $86 million, saving approximately $7 million in annualized interest cost. Also since last February, we've purchased 620,000 shares of our stock on the open market for $8.4 million and have paid $12 million in dividends. The number of shares used in the diluted earnings per share calculation will be 3.1 million shares lower, as a result of the third quarter convertible bond repurchase. We estimate the year-end diluted share count to be 38.6 million shares compared to 42.6 million shares in the fourth quarter of last year. With regard to our operating environment, our global commercial business continues to benefit from a generally healthy airline industry and to a lesser degree, a strong OEM build cycle. Further, there are a number of beneficial dynamics that are playing to our competitive strengths, mostly there's a clear continuation of the trend towards outsourcing. As customers seek a more comprehensive solution, which drives them to larger, better capitalized, more diversified service providers like AAR. We have experienced navigating the defense cycle both up and down. Flexibility is key and we are confident that we can make the necessary changes to the business to achieve acceptable returns. We will continue to manage our exposure to operational tempo in our portfolio and remain well positioned to capture the opportunities as they exist in the market, even during a downturn. Now I would like to provide some comments around specific segment performance. Within our Aviation Services segment, the strong commercial aftermarket advances our airframe maintenance and parts support businesses. Each is performing well and continues to demonstrate an ability to grow. We've been successful in growing our MRO profitability, as each of our established facilities is operating close to capacity and Duluth is ramping up. Demand remains high. Our efficiency and quality levels are good and our customers continue to be happy with our cost savings value proposition. We believe this is the right formula to continue to build market share, create scale and further improve on our margins. Our strategy across our commercial air freight services business is to build on the strong relationships we have with the airlines and leasing companies by doing higher quality work faster and with deep attention to detail and a greater level of efficiency and our customers can do for themselves or their competitors can offer. We believe that this value-added position also creates an opportunity to build our services business with the U.S. government, as they look to do more with less. Over time, we are confident we can leverage these relationships to create additional growth both in our airframe MRO and parts support businesses. While they offer separate services, these businesses have a common customer base. We're demonstrating an excellent broad side capabilities to our customers and we believe we can win incremental business. This includes for our supply chain, some discreet higher-margin aftermarket services. One good example is our recent signing of a contract, the Medical Logistics Support, which puts us in the same logistics market with a new product offering. We focus on executing it well to demonstrate our ability to efficiently manage supply chains regardless of the category. Our Airlift business performed well in the third quarter, meeting or exceeding all customer performance measures. This is a significant mission critical business. And I would note that funding for the contracts within this unit are coming out of the overseas contingency fund, which is not subject to sequestration. We have continued to provide superior levels of operational readiness and performance, have earned the support and trust of our customers. And we expect, longer term, we'll open other doors in new regions, new contracts and adjacent markets. I'd like to now turn to our Technology Products segment. We're pleased with the overall performance on our Cargo Systems business. We've recently consolidated the leadership structure for these businesses and our position to take better advantage of the strong OEM build cycle. Our goal is to be the clear leader in the Cargo Systems category through a combination of innovative intellectual property, Tier 1 relationships with the OEMs and strong engineering and aftermarket support capability. We are on a number of platforms, including the Airbus A320 family, the A330, the A340 and the soon to be certified A350. On Boeing, we are working on the 747-400, 767, and the new 747-8. On the A400M program, our customer recently accepted our first entry into service Cargo Systems, bringing that program 1 step closer to contributing to results. Our Nordics business has developed a low-age shipping container that is beginning to gain traction in the market. We recently won a meaningful order for this product that will begin shipping in our fourth quarter. During the period, we also completed the sale of 10 737-400s to the lessee during the -- which further reduced our investment in aircraft leasing. We're now down to 4 aircraft [indiscernible] joint ventures and 2 that are wholly-owned. I'd note that while we've made a conscious decision to drive down our invested capital in this business, our mix of capabilities puts us in an excellent position to continue to target aircraft modification, remarketing and sales. Along these lines, we'll be delivering the first of the commercial derivative aircraft for the Colombian Air Force in the fourth quarter, with the second aircraft scheduled for delivery in Q1 of fiscal 2014. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I'd like to stress, we have a leadership position in each of our core businesses to create significant organic growth opportunities and enables them to contribute to strong cash flow generation for the company. We've been able to use this cash to consistently drive value to our equity shareholders in a number of ways, including reducing our leverage. I'll reserve a few comments for closing. I would like to now turn the call over to Mike to take a closer look at our third quarter financials.
Michael J. Sharp:
Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. As is customary at this time, I would like to provide more color around the financial performance of the company during the third quarter including comments around interest, cash flow, capital expenditures and capital structure. And I will be around the rest of the day to answer any questions that you may have. Consolidated revenues for the third quarter, as David mentioned, were $520 million, which is down from last year due to the reduction in sales to the government and defense market. In the Aviation Services segment, sales increased 9% to $408 million with the increase all coming from organic growth. We saw strength at our parts support businesses driven by program activity. And as David described, each of our major airframe facilities are operating well and at high-capacity utilization. As you know, we recently opened a fifth MRO in Duluth to add 4 maintenance lines at peak capacity, or approximately 400,000 man-hours. Late in the third quarter, our customer added a second line to the facility, and we expect this facility to ramp at a measured pace over the balance of the calendar year. The reported gross profit margin in the Aviation Services segment was 14.5%. After you adjust for the loss on inventory, the gross margin is 16.7. This compares favorably to the prior year, but down on a sequential basis, primarily due to lower MRO margins as we bring in new work. We expect our margins to improve in the fourth quarter in this segment. Turning to the Technology Products segment. We've now lapped the timing of our Telair and Nordisk acquisitions, so their sales are included in both the current and prior years. The year-over-year decline in sales reported in this segment was due to lower sales at our Mobility Products unit, although sales at mobility were stable on a sequential basis. We also experienced a reduction in sales and earnings at our Cargo Systems businesses due to the timing of systems and spares sales, which we expect to see in the fourth quarter. Gross profit margin in the Technology Products segment was 15.4% and was unfavorably impacted by the softer results at Cargo Systems. We do expect improved gross margin performance in Q4 in this segment as well. I'd like to provide a bit more detail on the 2 transactions discussed in this afternoon's release. Although the 2 items largely offset each other, they did impact certain reported ratios, including gross profit margin and SG&A as a percent of sales. During the quarter, we were able to negotiate a final payment and the earn-out liability that we had established for the Airinmar acquisition. The final settlement was $9 million less than we had accrued. And accordingly, $9 million was recorded as a gain, and we recorded it as a reduction in SG&A expense. Also, we entered into a sales agreement with a buyer to acquire certain airframe inventory and entered into a separate agreement with the same buyer to market the inventory for a commission. We received $9.1 million cash in the third quarter and recorded a $9.1 million loss on inventory as a result of the transaction. We will recognize revenue from this transaction as the inventory is sold to third parties. After you adjust for the $9 million gain on the settlement of the Airinmar earnout, SG&A as a percent of sales was 9.8%, which is up slightly with last year but in line with our overall expectations. SG&A expenses were $500,000 less than the prior year, so we're doing an effective job of controlling, and in some categories, reducing our spend. Net interest expense for the third quarter was $9.8 million, a reduction of $400,000 from last year, due to overall lower debt levels. As David discussed, we remain very focused on generating cash and reducing our debt obligations. We target free cash flow at least equal to net income and are well ahead of that this fiscal year. During the quarter, we generated $27.5 million of cash from operations and our capital expenditures for Q3 were $4.8 million. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $87.8 million and year-to-date free cash flow is $75 million. Net debt to capital was 41% at February 28, 2013, down from 44% a year ago. Depreciation and amortization, including amortization of stock-based compensation, was $23 million for the third quarter. As it relates to our capital structure, in late January, certain holders of the 1 3/4 convertible notes surrendered their securities for purchase by us pursuant to the terms of the indenture. The aggregate amount surrendered by the bondholders and purchased by us was $62.8 million. In order to fund the purchase of these notes, we principally used cash on hand and free cash flow generated during Q3. In addition to these note purchases, we entered into an exchange transaction with another holder of the 1 3/4 convertible notes, whereby the holder exchanged their $22.7 million note plus $7.3 million cash for a new $30 million note. This new note was priced to yield 3.75% and matures on February 1, 2015. The underlying shares on the 1 3/4 convertible notes have historically been included in our share count for diluted earnings per share purposes. As a result of the convertible note transactions in the third quarter, 900,000 shares came out of the share count in Q3, an additional 2.2 million will come out in Q4. As David indicated previously, for modeling purposes, we recommend you use approximately 38.6 million shares for your fourth quarter share count. Lastly, with respect to guidance, as you've seen, we've increased our full year guidance again this quarter. This reflects our third quarter performance and visibility that we have into Q4. We now expect fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.78 to $1.82 per share. Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call back over to David for some closing comments.
David P. Storch:
Thanks, Mike, and solid report. We're pleased to have delivered another good quarter and we expect a strong finish to our fiscal year, even so we are not satisfied. We're driving hard to produce better levels of profitability across our business. And as we look at our growth opportunities, we'll focus on building out our leadership positions to make our value proposition more compelling to our customers. So with that, I'd like to thank you for your participation. And madam operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Hojo from Sidoti & Company.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
First question, just on the Airlift business. I get you have a great backlog visibility there still. And I also understand kind of the funding comes from the OCO budget, so you've got some production there. But in past quarters, you've talked to us about looking to diversify the Afghan exposure of that business. Can you perhaps talk a little bit about any progress on that front?
David P. Storch:
Yes. I'd say that we're making progress. All of our assets right now are fully employed, so we're working on a strategy to have assets that can be utilized elsewhere. But, yes, suffice to say that we have some interesting paths that we're exploring at this point.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Okay, David. Now at what point do you need to actually see some of those contracts come in before risking kind of pretty sharp decline in that business?
David P. Storch:
Well, I think we're expecting the level of activity that we're currently experiencing to continue for a period of time. So our -- the customers indicating to us at least that they don't see a softening of demand for -- through next year. So at this stage, we see that -- the pace continuing. Just to give you a sense, the number of flights and the number of hours that we're logging this December versus last December where -- is approximately 30,000 less troops, are very similar to each other, or in fact, slightly higher this year than prior year. So even with a reduction in force, it feels like that the demand is not tailing off. So I think you've heard me say this before, we don't -- we handle approximately 1,000 passengers a day. So you still have 66,000 American troops, I believe, in [indiscernible], 68,000. So our -- what we -- ideally, what we'd like is we'd like to have similar revenue opportunity -- or have similar revenue flows from other theaters. But right now, for the foreseeable future, this market continues to be relatively strong.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Okay. And just one last follow-on to that, can you remind us of when your big contracts there will be up for rebid, is it December?
David P. Storch:
Well, I don't know about rebid, but we have a bid that comes due -- we have, I'm sorry, we have an option that comes due in May. It's a fix swing option. We've been verbally told as we have in the past that, that will be exercised. And then we have a couple of meaningful options that come due in October and November later in this calendar year.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
Okay, great. And just one other question, if I may. Just as it pertains to the guidance, are there any planned aircraft sales in Q4? If so, could you quantify?
David P. Storch:
We have that 1 aircraft sale that we've -- that I talked about in my comments, the Colombian Air Force, which will be -- we will be delivering in Q4. And then we have a similar -- a sister ship that we'll be delivering in Q1 through year '14.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company, LLC:
But nothing out of any of the JVs?
David P. Storch:
We have 1 situation that's being worked, too hard for me to handicap, so I wouldn't want to commit to any further aircraft activity.
Operator:
And our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
You guys did a pretty good job explaining the gross margin issues this quarter, I was just curious, on the aviation side, if we strip out the inventory reduction or the sale of inventory, margins were still down sequentially. Was there anything else in there? Or is it just sort of -- revenue was sort of up sequentially, margin was down. Anything in there other than the inventory issue that you can call out?
Michael J. Sharp:
Larry, it's Mike. What I included in my comments when I talked about Aviation Services was that we had the inventory item and then we had lower margin sequentially at our airframe maintenance facilities principally related to bring in new work in Q3.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay. So just mostly -- that was in Duluth, I imagine, and that moved the needle that much?
Michael J. Sharp:
Duluth, and we also ramped up from new customers in Indianapolis, Larry.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay. That was sort of my next question, how are the other MRO facilities? What's the outlook there?
Michael J. Sharp:
They are busy. We've taken on some new lines of work for a particular customer that we're kind of in the learning curve on. But we expect to have -- see that turn around here in Q4.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay. And on the defense side. I know that the -- it looks like the Airlift businesses certainly improved executional. How about the precision on the UN business? That was also having some issues a few quarters back.
Michael J. Sharp:
It's better. It's -- we've been talking about kind of sequential improvement and we've seen that. Still not where we want it, but we have a leadership team in place there that's committed to getting the business towards generating reasonable returns for us. So I would say that it's better and it continues to get better. But still not where we want it.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay. And on the -- just on the -- some of the acquisitions, any -- Telair, you mentioned some of the programs you guys are in. Year-over-year, could you tell us how that did and what the outlook is for that business?
Michael J. Sharp:
So what I mentioned, Larry, in my comments in Technology Products was that the Cargo Systems business had a softer Q3 principally around timing of spares and some system shipments, which we expect to get back to more normal levels in Q4.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay. And by normal, is that sort of running -- is it sort of low-single digit growth? Or what is it? I know year-over-year, like -- excluding the sort of lumpy year from the timing of orders.
Michael J. Sharp:
In terms of forecast for that business for Q4?
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Or just how it's -- yes, or a forecast for 4 as you look out over the next few quarters or what sort of...
Michael J. Sharp:
No, no, we see a nice improvement in Q4. And Larry, we're also very pleased with -- as David mentioned with our position here. We're on great long-term programs and as the A350 comes online, we're going to be well positioned there. So the future for this business is excellent and it's performed very well since the acquisition and the performance next quarter is going to be very solid as well.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
And just if I may, just one quick -- on the reduced earn out on Airinmar, is that reflecting that it's not quite performing up to expectations? Or would that earnout have been where it would have been exceeding expectations?
Michael J. Sharp:
The businesses has been performing very well for us, particularly in helping us with our internal spend on programs. So we've been pleased with the performance of the business. The earnout is a mathematical formula and it was in both parties' interest to negotiate this conclusion.
Lawrence Solow - CJS Securities, Inc.:
Okay, just lastly. David talked about just macro trends and outsourcing, sort of the stars aligning. It seems like that number should continue to rise. It's been on a secular trend in the last couple of decades. Just in terms of American Air and U.S. Air consolidating. And I know American Air has not normally been a big outsourcer. Any thoughts on that and how that may impact your performance?
Michael J. Sharp:
I think it's a little early, Larry. My view is that the U.S. Air team will ingest some creative thinking into the American organization, but I'd be hopeful and somewhat optimistic, but I wouldn't be, at this stage, factoring anything in. It's a little bit too early.
Operator:
And our next question comes from the line of Michael Callahan from Topeka Capital Markets. And it seems that he has removed himself. Our next question comes from the line of J. B. Groh from D.A. Davidson.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
Did you address sort of MRO and sort of where you are in terms of capacity utilization there? I don't know if Duluth is contributing yet or not, but could you kind of go over that?
Michael J. Sharp:
Yes, we touched on it actually and Duluth is contributing. The shop there are all very busy. We are ramping up some new programs across our various facilities that have a little bit of drag on margins this quarter. We expect better margins next quarter. Duluth is, I think, been a terrific story in terms of going from a mothball plant to a plant that has 2 lines of work going today. But still, we're looking for people and we want to get the ramp to 3 and then 4 lines as quickly as possible. But the MRO business is doing well. There's good demand for our services and our performance has been balanced very good.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
Okay. What do you think on the acquisition front that you're -- how's that pipeline looking, what's the appetite like currently, versus what it's been in the past?
David P. Storch:
There are some interesting things, J. B., so we're kind of -- we have our finger in -- out there, kind of in the mix, if you will. And I think what I'm saying is that any acquisitions we do will be to strengthen the leadership positions we have in the -- from markets we've been discussing. So anything that comes up that improves our supply chain deliverables, anything that improves our MRO capability, anything that improves our Cargo Systems, we'll be looking at those opportunities very closely.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
And then lastly, could you talk about sort of what you think? You guys have a sort of unique perspective on, I think, airline inventory levels? Could you talk about what you're seeing there in terms of burned down, or rebuild, or steady-state?
David P. Storch:
I think the airlines are watching their inventory levels very closely. And my sense is that you're probably going through a little bit of a burn down at present. And I would imagine that, that will -- should continue for a short period, but then they'll probably get their inventory positions ready for the strong summer season they're expecting.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
So when do you expect that to kind of bottom?
David P. Storch:
Say that again?
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division:
When do you expect that to bottom, the...
David P. Storch:
I think as we sit here today, it's probably bottomed.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions] And we have Michael Callahan, again, from Topeka Capital Markets.
Michael Callahan - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division:
So I apologize if this was asked while I was signing back in here, but I don't know about the structures business, did you guys give any -- or do you guys have any insight, I guess, with respect to assuming the current budget passes, or the Appropriations Bill passes the House and Senate and goes through. Does that lead you guys to believe there will be any improvement in that business? Or have orders been held back at all? Or is this just kind of the result of, I guess, the drawdown on Iraq and Afghanistan?
David P. Storch:
Yes, I think it's a combination. I think we're -- the business is giving us a -- continues to give us a good return on capital and the business continues to operate efficiently. I believe that the requirements are down as a result of both factors you indicated. And we were planning on those requirements staying down for a period of time. So as we look at Q4 for instance, we don't see any major changes. You might have slightly up, slightly down, but nothing -- no significant directional changes. And as we enter the new fiscal year, I think we're looking at relatively flat to where we are today. So we've been in this situation before with this business. We're a little bit, I think, stronger this cycle than we've been other cycles. So I would anticipate there will be a tough slide for this business for a period of time.
Michael Callahan - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division:
Okay. That was helpful. Maybe one last one here, just as far as the aftermarket trends what you're seeing throughout the quarter, it seems like you guys reported a little bit stronger of a quarter maybe than the guys who finished at a normal calendar year for this kind of same time period. So did you see strengthening, as the quarter progressed? Or -- and how did things look towards the end? Or can you give any color there?
David P. Storch:
I think it was fairly consistent throughout. I can't say that we saw any change. Keep in mind now, our -- this quarter is a low quarter to begin with, because you're dealing with the December, January and February period. So December is typically soft, due to the holidays. And February's soft, because it only has 28 days. So historically, this has been our softest quarter. Now that said, we had nice growth over prior year and I think a lot of that is due to some of the stuff that we've been talking about in terms of our positioning and our customer interaction and our performance. So I think as we look out into Q4, I think if you look at our commercial growth rates, versus many of our people also selling to the commercial markets over the last 3 or 4 years, I think you'll see that we've given a pretty good accounting for ourselves. So I would anticipate that, that will continue.
Operator:
And we have no further questions at this time.
David P. Storch:
Okay. Well, thank you very much for participating. I wish everybody a very pleasant day.
Operator:

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, David Storch.
David Storch:
Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. Joining me today in our Chicago headquarters is Tim Romenesko, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Rick Poulton, our Chief Financial Officer. We reported our third quarter results last night and trust that you’ve had a chance to review our press release. As you all know, the economic environment in the United States has continued to deteriorate with calendar year fourth quarter GDP a negative 6.2% and U.S. unemployment at the highest rate since 1983. As a result of weak economic conditions, both business and leisure travelers have reduced air travel, causing airlines to reduce capacity and seek ways to reduce cost, and conserve cash. Capacity in North America is down approximately 8% during the first quarter of calendar year 2009 compared to last year and passenger traffic in North America is down approximately 10%. International traffic for certain of the carriers is worse with some carriers reporting declines in international traffic well in excess of 10%. While carriers are benefiting from the impact of lower jet fuel prices, additional capacity reductions may occur as a result of continued weakness and consumer confidence and declining business travel. As airlines reduce capacity, it causes significant changes to their maintenance schedules, which in turn drives disruption to the demand pull for parts and services. Now, we have not been immune to the capacity reductions impacting the industry as we reported a 6.8% decline in sales to commercial customers, which excludes our Aircraft Sales and Leasing business. We were impacted at our Indianapolis MRO where we experienced lower sales as a result of the United Airlines decision last spring to ground their 737-300 fleet as well as FedEx’s decision to retire a portion of their 727 aircraft. We are in discussions with other potential customers who have expressed interest in this world-class facility and we continue to perform work for Southwest. As a result of the weak economic conditions and tight credit markets, we are focused on reducing our investment in our aircraft portfolio. Our equity investment in our joint venture and wholly-owned aircraft portfolio is approximately $80 million at February 28, 2009. Of the 33 aircrafts in our portfolio, 32 aircraft are on lease and we have only – and we have one wholly-owned aircraft coming off lease in the fourth quarter, which will be disassembled for parts. There are two leased aircrafts on our wholly-owned portfolio in which the lessee is behind in their payments. We’ve obtained the judgment against the parent of the operator of the aircrafts and expect to recover amounts owed to us. Other than those two aircrafts, all the other aircrafts continue to operate according to our agreements. Further, as we deemphasize this business, we are considering combining the activities of our Aircraft Sales and Leasing segment with the Aviation Supply Chain segment for our next fiscal year. While the environment remains challenging, we believe the business strategy we adopted several years ago has positioned us well to respond to these challenges. Specifically, through target investments and business acquisitions as well as organic growth, we’ve been executing a strategy of building balance, balance across our two major customer segments, commercial and defense, as well as balance in our product and services offerings between front-end manufactured content and back-end aftermarket support. Our goals in embarking on this strategy have always been two-fold, first, to mitigate short term earnings volatility by insulating our exposure to any one segment of industry, and, second, to generate opportunity over the longer term by creating larger addressable market opportunities. Looking back on our third quarter, we see the value in executing this strategy as our results held up nicely despite a very difficult commercial environment and certainly held up much better than we’ve seen in prior downturns. We remain optimistic on longer term fundamentals for both the commercial and defense markets we serve and continue to position ourselves for long term success. For example, we recently opened an office in Abu Dhabi, which is staffed by one of our senior marketing executives to address growing opportunities in this region and we expect to see results shortly. And I should say meaningful results. In yesterday’s release, we discussed that we were a net investor of cash during the third quarter. We used $16 million of cash from operations as we made significant investments in inventory and rotable assets to support our commercial customers. We expect cash – solid cash from operations in the fourth quarter as we do not have any large planned asset purchases. Thank you all for joining the conference call today. And we would like to now open up the line for any questions you may have.
Operator:
(Operator instructions) Our first question is from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Hi good morning. Can you maybe discuss your Aviation Supply, it looks like your margins actually were, it surprised me, held up pretty well, obviously I know they have the last couple of quarters, but are the – first of all, the bigger ticket items, are those lower margin? Were you – kind of your sales were kind of down a little bit and was it due to better mix or what was the color on that?
Tim Romenesko:
Well, I think the – I think, Larry, the – but just the volumes were lower in big ticket items and at the components shop.
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Right.
Tim Romenesko:
And the margin on big ticket items can – it’s volatile. They are – sometimes they are modest, but other times they can be significant. So, I think you have just a – recently experienced in the quarter just a general softness in demand for parts and then it was exacerbated by the lack of any engines or large structural components.
Rick Poulton:
Larry, it’s Rick. I’d just add to what Tim said (inaudible) by pointing out that as part of what we described is some of the revenue weakness, which was really out of our component repair shops. Those tend to be a little lower margin than the other aspects inside Supply Chain. So you are getting a little bit of margin left as those things show some softness.
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Got it. And I know you’ve had some weakness in the European component shop and you talked about some potential actions taken and I guess I see you’ve had some headcount reductions there and severance costs. Any other actions you could take or –?
Tim Romenesko:
We are working it. We are working both the cost side and the business development side. We’ve – we’ve moved a team in there now and working on improving the performance there. We’ve got some things that we are working on that are going to help. So, it’s a priority.
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Got you. And then just last question. Can you, Tim, maybe just discuss – I see recent – looks like recent trends are at least stabilizing. You mentioned last couple of weeks in you press release kind of during the quarter did things get progressively worse in the Aviation Supply as capacity started to come off or how that play itself out?
Tim Romenesko:
No, the – it got better actually. February was a strong month and we are seeing the volumes in March continue to track.
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Okay. And then in MRO, in the Indianapolis facility, could you just give us the update, I guess it’s only Southwestern now and how many hangers are we occupying?
Tim Romenesko:
It’s fluctuating between seven and eight.
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Okay. That’s all Southwest?
Tim Romenesko:
Correct.
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Okay.
Tim Romenesko:
But that includes some wing at work and things like that that are – produce less revenue than solid – the maintenance line.
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Okay.
Tim Romenesko:
So, the hanger count is not necessarily indicative of the activity level.
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Got you. Okay good. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you, sir. Our next question or comment is from Tyler Hojo of Sidoti and Company. Your line is open.
Tyler Hojo – Sidoti & Company:
Good morning. Just quickly on the 33 aircraft that you guys owned, how does that break between JV and wholly-owned.
David Storch:
26 JV, Tyler, and seven wholly-owned.
Tyler Hojo – Sidoti & Company:
Okay great. And I was hoping that maybe you could comment a little bit just in regards to the work stoppage in the Miami Landing Gear facility. Maybe if you can quantify what the impact in the quarter was and how maybe that is going to impact any potential sequential uptick in business in the fourth quarter.
David Storch:
Tyler, we think that the impact on revenue was between $3 million and $3.5 million. We expect to have that flow through relatively quickly. The rework that’s being done is in process. So I think we’ll be through the bulk of that in Q4 and in Q1. We think that the margin and the operating income impact is about $1 million from – that came out of the third quarter that will go into Q4 and Q1.
Tyler Hojo – Sidoti & Company:
Okay. And I guess just based on some of your prepared comments there I mean is it safe to say that you really don’t have a whole lot of visibility and I guess just using Indy as an example with the seven to eight days just in regards to that capacity going up or staying stable or going down, I mean is still visibility just not very good in order to maybe comment further there?
Tim Romenesko:
No, I think we have fairly decent visibility. I mean we feel very good about our relationship with the customer we have today. And obviously we’ve been working diligently of late to replace the business that disappears as a result of grounding. And we have some stuff that we are working on that we – we feel our capture rate – we have confidence in our ability to capture some of the stuff that we are looking at.
Tyler Hojo – Sidoti & Company:
Okay.
Tim Romenesko:
We would anticipate that Indianapolis a year from now will be in stronger position than it is today.
Tyler Hojo – Sidoti & Company:
Alight. And the work with Southwest, the expectation was that going to go up in the fourth quarter. Is that correct?
Tim Romenesko:
I don’t know that for sure. I think there is changes in Southwest re-planning as well. So I wouldn’t count on that.
Tyler Hojo – Sidoti & Company:
Okay. Alright great. Thanks very much.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Eric Hugel of Stephens Inc. Your line is open.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Hey, good morning guys.
David Storch:
Eric, good morning.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Can you comment – I mean, I guess one of the key buzzwords that we’ve been hearing from a lot of your I guess fellow aftermarket peers has been even over and above sort of the weak traffic numbers we’ve been seeing, sort of trends of airline de-stocking. But those trends don’t seem to – they only last a couple of quarters. Can you talk to us about where you think we are in that cycle and sort of – it is maybe February and March improving, maybe a sign that we are close to the end of sort of these de-stocking?
David Storch:
I think it’s hard to predict, Eric, only as it relates to – try and understand what’s happening to the fleets. I think if the fleet stabilize you are probably correct, but if the fleets continue to come down a little bit then you could have more of that effect going forward. But our sense is that if you track the business on a weekly basis, obviously, which we are doing, the business is showing some strength. So, there demand seems to be stabilizing if you will, possibly increasing slightly.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Okay.
Tim Romenesko:
We clearly had a low back in December and we’ve seen some pickup since then.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Okay great. With regards to – I guess you recently, I guess maybe a couple of months back, there was a big award that you guys won, I guess it was make tactical shelters for the FMTV, but I guess was supposed to start up this in the third quarter and I guess ramp to maybe full by the fourth quarter. Is that sort of on track, is that how we should be thinking about it?
David Storch:
It is on track. It is on track, Eric, and it is.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Okay. Are there any other big sort of programs? You referred to a couple of them because I mean your defense numbers looked really strong.
David Storch:
You know, the numbers are strong. The performance, particularly at the mobility systems business is strong. We’re continuing to add to the – win new business at least and we are doing a good job delivering against our backlog.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Can you talk about the sustainability of that kind of growth of maybe high-single digit growth? Is that sustainable or is like maybe the revenue level is sustainable?
David Storch:
No, I think there is going to be at least a modest uptick in revenue and the outlook continues to be good through our early fiscal 2011. So, we are encouraged.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Can you comment on defense side also on the performance based logistics opportunities you are seeing out there?
David Storch:
There is opportunities that we are working. Clearly, we are continuing to execute well on the programs that we have and we are looking to add to them.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
But nothing that we would – nothing material that you would prefer to think is in relative near term, just sort of just general environment?
David Storch:
Right.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Okay. Thanks a lot guys. I get back into the queue.
Operator:
Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Jim Okshow [ph] of ABH [ph]. Sir, your line is open.
Jim Okshow – ABH:
Good morning, gentlemen. I got a couple of questions relating to the aircraft leasing, both the planes you outright and the joint venture. First of all, do you have any leases that are expiring this year?
David Storch:
We had a lease, as we indicated, that expires this quarter. The aircraft comes off lease in May. And the aircraft is attractively priced. It’s wholly owned by the Company and the aircraft will go into disassembly where we have demand for the parts for those – for that aircraft. We have – other than that, I don’t believe we have any other aircrafts that come due this fiscal year or this calendar–-
Tim Romenesko:
Just the one. We do have some –later in the calendar year.
Jim Okshow – ABH:
How many later in the year, in the calendar year?
Tim Romenesko:
For the full fiscal year ’10, we have – it’s either six or seven repricing. They don’t start until Q2 and they are spread out to the balance of the year. So, I am just going to (inaudible) my head here, but it’s somewhere in the three to four range probably.
Jim Okshow – ABH:
You just said repricing, what does that mean?
Tim Romenesko:
Meaning leases coming to term.
Jim Okshow – ABH:
Okay, okay. Could you give a breakdown of what kind of aircraft you have in the fleet, I mean how many – I don’t know if you want to go plane-by-plane, but how many are new generation and how many narrow bodies and how many wide bodies?
David Storch:
We have three wide bodies. We have two 767-300s on lease long term with United. And we have one 747-400 on lease with Northwest-Delta. We then have two A320s on lease and we – I am sorry, we have three A320s on lease. And then we have – the balance of the fleet would be 737s 300s and 400s and one 737-500.
Jim Okshow – ABH:
Okay. The – just final questions and put together. First of all, do you anticipate particularly with the 737s any need for any writedowns and in light of what you said about deemphasizing this business, are you planning to offer any of these planes – any of the planes in the fleet for sale?
David Storch:
Well, we do have – a couple of the airplanes are offered for sale, but at this moment we think we have a good position in the aircraft. And we are deemphasizing because the capital markets are not extremely bullish in this kind of activity. So, we are not – we don’t see the same opportunities. There is a huge spread between what buyers want to pay and what sellers think the assets are worth and we see that continuing for a period of time.
Jim Okshow – ABH:
Okay. So, when you say deemphasize, does that mean just that you are not going to be looking to add more planes or (inaudible) act at looking at get out of this business and sell what you have?
David Storch:
Well, I think clearly on the front-end, where we haven’t added an aircraft into our portfolio since November’07, so I think that the facts speak for themselves in that regard in terms of adding. And in terms of selling we have sold – we have been a seller of these aircrafts since then. We continue to operate the leases and look for opportunities to sell the assets. So that would be the way I would characterize it.
Jim Okshow – ABH:
Thank you very much.
David Storch:
Yes.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Tom Louis [ph] of (inaudible). Your line is open.
Tom Louis:
Yes, good morning.
David Storch:
Hi Tom.
Tom Louis:
I was hoping for a little clarification on – you are clearly, you are enjoying a nice – some nice growth in your mobility business. Can you talk a little bit about the extent to which this might be due to capabilities you’ve added in the last few years as opposed to just the government’s need to protect its presence? Also, can you talk about the – what sort of visibility you might have against the day that this is not going to be a source of growth anymore and about your alternative uses for these capabilities or your ability to otherwise manage those assets at reduced volumes.
David Storch:
Well, the first part of your question, Tom, is we’ve expanded our product line quite dramatically. We made the acquisition of Brown Engineering a couple of years back and – a year and a half back or so, and Brown Engineering gets us into the command and communications world and environment. We think that world continues to show opportunities going forward. We feel good about the breadth of the product line today versus where it was in the past. We have capability – we are now – have these mobile shelters that – going on the back of the trucks and things of that nature. We are getting a lot better at stuffing the shelters than we were in the past. So, yes, I think the product line is definitely broader than it was in the past. And I think as it relates to moving forward, as I said in my opening comments, we feel very good about the balance to our portfolio that we have today and historically when the commercial airline business has been a little softer that business has been a little stronger and vice versa to some extent as well. So, I think that the story is around how we are fairing through this downturn versus how we faired through previous downturns, which you’ve been with us through. And I think that this – I think we are in a good position in that business. I don’t see world tensions diminishing in an appreciable fashion. They may move from theater to theater, but clearly the U.S.’ capability of moving into different theaters becomes more pressing and – one theater that’s developing, quite frankly, for the Company is the Southwest United States. And so there is I think broad range of applications for our product today as the product continues to broaden itself.
Tom Louis:
So, maybe moving to Texas wasn’t such good idea. Okay. Now, with respect to the Aircraft Sales and Leasing, is there anything in this year your willingness to – or your decision to talking to deemphasizing, I mean you’ve got – clearly, where we are cyclically speaking and the state of the – present state of the capital markets, but if we think of this business compared to maybe the way we would have perceived it five of ten years ago, is there more to it than that or is it those two factors?
David Storch:
I think it’s also resource allocation for AAR. We see greater opportunities else where. And we feel really good about our positions in the other three markets. And this market – we’ve always been just a dabbler in that market and I think it’s time for us at least to dabble a little bit less.
Tom Louis:
Okay. And just one last question kind of under the vein of resource allocation. You had the opportunity during the quarter to buy back some of your converts. It was real obviously early in the quarter prior to the end of the last calendar year that there were a lot of motivated sellers among the holders of various convertible bonds out there. My sense is it’s a lot less so, but do you still see an opportunity to meet with a motivated potential – with motivated sellers on this part of managing your capital structure.
David Storch:
Yes, Tom, from time to time we are getting phone calls from capital market folks who were representing people who have bonds that they would like to liquefy. So that has not – that has not diminished. And I can't really tell you what that’s going to look like 90 days from now, but as we sit here today they are still – those opportunities still do exist for the Company.
Tom Louis:
Okay great. Thanks a lot guys.
David Storch:
Yes.
Operator:
Yes, thank you, sir. Our next question or comment is from Jon Braatz of Kansas City Capital. Your line is open.
Jon Braatz – Kansas City Capital:
Good morning gentlemen.
David Storch:
Good morning.
Jon Braatz – Kansas City Capital:
When we look at the MRO facility in Indianapolis, did we see the full brunt of the slowdown in the loss of FedEx and United Airlines in the quarter or did that get progressively worse as the quarter progressed?
David Storch:
No, you saw the full brunt within the quarter.
Jon Braatz – Kansas City Capital:
Okay alright. And then secondly, during the year we saw there were a couple of FAA issues, Landing Gear and on the Boeing plant I think it was, is there anything you can do to I guess I don’t want to – and I don’t want to assign blame or anything like that – to be somewhat more proactive or work with the FAA more quickly so that these things don’t get out into the public view because that will cause a little bit of a investor anxiety? But is there anything that can be done in a private manner so that these things are resolved, let’s say, more quickly?
David Storch:
Absolutely. We could have done a better job here. And we have a lesson learned, if you will, a tough lesson, a hard lesson. And shame on us to some extent. But, yes, definitely we are much more cognizant. It was an unfortunate wake up call in this context. But keep in mind now, safety of flight was never an issue, quality was never an issue, more about relationship management more than anything else. And, yes, we can do a better job in the relationship management. And I have – since this even, I have held meetings with the senior people from the flight safety and flight standards group within the FAA in Washington, D.C., and I will be meeting on a one-on-one basis with the head of the Miami (inaudible) on April 6. So, yes, clearly, we could have been – done a better job at the front end here.
Jon Braatz – Kansas City Capital:
Okay, David, is it true, is my understanding correct that let’s say an FAA inspector in Oklahoma could have a different interpretation of the rules of an FAA inspector in Miami? Is it –?
David Storch:
I don’t know. I won't necessarily characterize it that way, but I would say that the local SIFDOs [ph] are powerful in and of themselves and need to be reckoned with in their – in the – on the locale in which they are operating. But, yes, I mean in this case here we’ve been in the Miami operation now since late 80s. We’ve had relationship where we let the relationships – my interpretation is that we let the relationship get away from us. And we have to do a better job on the front-end in that relationship aspect.
Jon Braatz – Kansas City Capital:
Okay. Alright. Thank you.
David Storch:
Yes. But you should know also that the FAA holds the Company in very high regard, and that was conveyed to me when I was in D.C., and like I said – I just want to reiterate it, this was never a safety of flight issue, never a quality issue. And as you can tell, the parts have not been recalled or anything of that nature. So – okay.
Jon Braatz – Kansas City Capital:
I understand. Thank you.
David Storch:
Okay. Alright.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from JB Groh of DA Davidson. Your line is open.
JB Groh – DA Davidson & Co.:
Good morning guys. Just a couple clarification questions on the margins. On the Structures the margin came down a little bit sequentially, is that just a mix issue or – what – remind me why it was so strong last quarter and dropped a little bit this quarter.
Tim Romenesko:
I think if you looked historically, JB, you’d see that this quarter’s performance is sort of more in line with what you would you have – what would you’ve seen as trend line – we’ve been fractioning [ph] up the margin in this area, but somewhere in the 15% [ph] or just under is more in line with what you’ve seen historically. So, last quarter’s was a little bit of an aberration. And it was product mix or anything.
JB Groh – DA Davidson & Co.:
Okay. And then on the Aircraft Sales and Leasing (inaudible) that looks kind of strange, is that due to the parting out of the aircraft or what makes that number look a little odd?
Tim Romenesko:
Sorry, which number –?
JB Groh – DA Davidson & Co.:
In the Aircraft Sales and Leasing –?
Tim Romenesko:
Gross profit or –?
JB Groh – DA Davidson & Co.:
Yes, gross – I mean it shows up, it’s like a 50% gross profit margin. I am just guessing that has something to do with parting out the aircraft or –?
Tim Romenesko:
Yes, it’s really just – it’s just least revenue. That tends to be a very high margin area when you have very little revenue. So, in the past, if you look back, when we sell an aircraft from our own portfolio, you have more sales and then you sort to actually have a slightly lower margin. But the lease revenue on – which doesn’t show up as a – it tends to be a very high margin area, J. B., so I think it’s just a kind of a (inaudible) small number so–
JB Groh – DA Davidson & Co.:
Okay. Okay. Okay. And then I don’t know, I am not sure if you gave a depreciation and amortization number for the quarter.
Rick Poulton:
We gave some (inaudible) it’s $9.7 million for the quarter.
JB Groh – DA Davidson & Co.:
Okay. Thanks a lot. That’s all I have.
Operator:
Thank you, sir. Our next question or comment is from Henry Kennedy [ph] of Overhaul and Maintenance [ph]. Your line is open.
Henry Kennedy – Overhaul and Maintenance:
Hi good morning. You mentioned before that your long term strategy includes growth, internal growth and acquisitions. Could you speak a little bit about what kind of acquisitions you might at least be interested in over the next year, where they might be or are you looking at anything in commercial overhaul or you are trying to sort of balance your portfolio away from commercial overhaul?
Henry Kennedy – Overhaul and Maintenance:
Tim Romenesko:
Henry, the comment, you know – just to be clear – the comment upfront was that we had made acquisitions and investments and targeted some of our organic growth in a (inaudible) enterprise. So, going backwards, there was an effort to get more defense exposure, little more front-end content exposure and that’s where we had been emphasizing. As we look ahead, we continue to see organic investment opportunities as well as acquisition opportunities, are all ways of – for us of using some of the cash we generate. I don’t know that we have a specific priority right now, but we are interested in serving both major customer segments and we are interested in continuing to serve them both with front-end content as well as aftermarket services. So, I think all of the above are in solutions for us.
Henry Kennedy – Overhaul and Maintenance:
Okay. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Rick [ph] of Columbia Management. Your line is open.
Rick – Columbia Management:
Yes, just a follow-up on the Landing Gear shutdown. Has there – can you characterize the customer response once you were back up running, I guess, only five days later, has there been any kind of backlash or negative response.
Tim Romenesko:
No. I would say there was concern obviously around the disruption as we were going through it, but we tried to keep the customers as current as we could in terms of what was happening. Since it’s been resolved, we’ve been visited by all of our customers, basically. And I would say that there is no backlash, if you will, in terms of gear coming into the facility for repair.
Rick – Columbia Management:
So, you don’t expect to lose any material business from that event?
Tim Romenesko:
That’s right. And we are working hard to make sure that that doesn’t happen.
Rick – Columbia Management:
Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator:
Thank you. And our next question or comment is from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Just a follow-up to Rick’s comments and I believe someone else asked about Southwest, if I am not mistaken, did Southwest recently actually expand their relationship on – with your Landing Gear Services?
Tim Romenesko:
We do Landing Gear for Southwest, yes?
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Well, didn’t they – I think I read in one of the aviation magazines, they actually increased their exposure I mean or their – I guess their planned volume in you facility, is that incorrect or –?
Tim Romenesko:
No, I am sure that that’s correct.
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Okay. Just one question on SG&A. It seems like if you strip out the severance and (inaudible) that’s flat on a year-over-year basis, is that a kind of a good way to look at it going forward or –?
Rick Poulton:
In absolute dollars, Larry, that’s – you are correct in your assessment and – yes, I mean we are very focused on managing SG&A, very focused given the environment.
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Okay. And then just last question. Any color – how about the other – the MRO facilities at Oklahoma doing and (inaudible)?
David Storch:
They are both busy.
Larry Solow – CJS Securities:
Okay. That’s good. Okay good. Thanks.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Stan Mann [ph] of Mann Family Investment [ph]. Your line is open.
Stan Mann – Mann Family Investment:
Good morning gentlemen. I have a question on, one, on use of cash. You did comment that you – possibly on acquisitions, et cetera. In this current market with financing not available, would you say the use of cash would be more for buying and converts and maybe paying down debt, et cetera? So, could you comment on your – the way you view use of cash in this environment?
David Storch:
Stan, first of all, hello.
Stan Mann – Mann Family Investment:
Hello.
David Storch:
Been a while. Okay, good morning. You know, I think it’s around balance. It’s clearly looking for – our first use of cash is – it’s all around yield and return on capital, so wherever we feel we can get the best return for our capital. Right now, if you look at the (inaudible) we felt very good about putting some capital to work, taking advantage of some buying opportunities. And we put some capital to work on investment in longer lived assets. We, for instance, acquired a ship set, a 777 landing gear for approximately $8 million from Delta Airlines and secured a multi-year contract from them as a result of putting that capital to work. We also acquired some bonds that we felt were attractively priced. As you can see, we have a 9% yield. Our cost of incremental capital is – or incremental dollars is – it’s a real positive arbitrage for us, let me put it that way. So, yes, I think it’s a balance. You know, we are constantly looking for ways to maximize the dollars that we put to work.
Stan Mann – Mann Family Investment:
Well, what I was getting at it it’s less likely that we’ll see a large acquisition as we had seen in the past couple of years in the current environment that’s all I was asking.
David Storch:
Yes, I would say that if we were to do an acquisition, it would be obviously accretive, first of all. Secondly, I think we’d be looking for a way to finance it that would be appropriate. But at this moment, we have a couple of minor situations that we are looking at in the overall scheme of things and, yes, so I think the opportunity would have to be a good opportunity that made sense for our portfolio.
Stan Mann – Mann Family Investment:
Okay. Second question on operating margin, it slipped, obviously. So, if you put back some of the non-recurring severance, et cetera, do you still see your near term goals above 10% operating margin?
David Storch:
Yes.
Stan Mann – Mann Family Investment:
Seems like we reached pretty close in this quarter to back things then–
David Storch:
Yes, yes correct.
Stan Mann – Mann Family Investment:
So, you–
David Storch:
And it’s hard, but yes that –
Stan Mann – Mann Family Investment:
Yes.
David Storch:
Keep in mind, also, a piece of the strategy to get the margins from 10% to 12.5% for instance is around the Aircraft Sales and Leasing portfolio. So, we are going to be diminishing that. And that will add a – create a little bit more pressure on bringing the margins up in the short term.
Stan Mann – Mann Family Investment:
In the short term. Well you still have moved up operating profit dollars tremendously in the last three, four years. So –
David Storch:
That’s –
Stan Mann – Mann Family Investment:
It’s a really different ball game.
David Storch:
Yes, that’s correct.
Stan Mann – Mann Family Investment:
Anyway, I think it’s a good job in this environment. Thank you.
David Storch:
Thank you very much.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Eric Hugel of Stephens Inc. Your line is open.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Hey guys, just a couple of follow-ups. The MRO segment, I guess, 2.9% growth year-over-year, but you had the Avborne acquisition in there. What was the organic growth or what was Avborne round about?
Rick Poulton:
Avborne – we’ve talked in the past about the size of Avborne, and so just to reiterate that, that’s somewhere between $10 million and $15 million per quarter, okay? So, I won't get anymore specific than that but you can kind of play around with the numbers based on that information.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Alright. So the organic growth in that business was something like maybe 10% to 13%, 10% to 15% or something like that and that would have been impacted by the MRO (inaudible) by the landing gear [ph]. Okay. Second, can you talk about the Aviation Supply Chain, one of the impacts – and I just trying to sort of work my brain through – I mean you talked about the FX impact. Is that FX impact more sort of just visual in terms of your having lower sales, but higher operating income or is there no net impact or are there real sort of EPS impacts there?
Rick Poulton:
The EPS impact would be much more modest, so that’s why we are not really talking about it in EPS level. We have a pretty good natural hedge to the operation. But on the top line you see the impact.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Can you talk about how much the top line impact was with regards to FX?
Rick Poulton:
It was in the neighborhood of a couple of million dollars, Eric.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Okay. What was CapEx in the quarter?
Rick Poulton:
Just under $7 million – $6.8 million.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Can you give us an update on how things are going with regards to the ramp up on the new composites expansion as well as how things are going with Summa, I know there are some headwinds there with regards to Gulfstream.
Tim Romenesko:
On composites, the Sacramento facility is up and running. The – looking for – looking some more work, but nonetheless operating. In terms of Summa, the volumes continue to be strong there. We are looking – I am actually going to be visiting there this afternoon. We are encouraged by some of the prospects we have down there. We do have some work to do on some particular programs. But we’ll work on those, we’ll work through them. So, I think on balance, I think we feel good about what’s going on down at Summa.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Okay. Can you give us – maybe a round a ballpark figure as to sort of this new composites facility? I mean is it sort of delivering meaningful additional contribution or is this still just pretty small right now.
Tim Romenesko:
No, it’s still small, but it’s – it positions us very nicely as the – as demand for composite materials increases. So, it’s a great facility with tremendous capability that puts us in a nice place in a market that we see as really taking off here in the next three to five years.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
And your goal is still over that time period what you said $80 million to $90 million of sales?
David Storch:
Well, we are looking at for the –the composite business in total is $100 million for the two businesses.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Okay.
David Storch:
We are doing today roughly what $35 million – approximately $35 million today, we are looking to get to $100 million in five years. That’s in our plan. Now, we have two – if you look at the operation now in Sacramento, we have two very large defense oriented contracts that are being worked at this – at this time. And too hard to handicap whether we’ll be successful or not, but if we are, we’ll get to that target quicker, sooner rather than later.
Eric Hugel – Stephens Inc.:
Great. That’s perfect. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator:
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Our next question is from Tyler Hojo of Sidoti and Company. Your line is open.
Tyler Hojo – Sidoti & Company:
You guys just answered my follow-up question. Thanks.
Operator:
Thank you, sir. Our next follow-up is from JB Groh of DA Davidson. Your line is open.
JB Groh – DA Davidson & Co.:
Yes, one more question. Just on inventory, is there a way to look at that in terms of ageing and quality in light of all these retirements that we are seeing, is there a way you can sort of give us a framework to think about that?
Rick Poulton:
Yes, I mean J.B., we monitor that closely by looking at turns data and we also do look at ageing data for our inventory. And our – we haven’t seen any fall back in our major metrics there. And so in particular ageing more than about 85% of the inventory balance has been acquired within the – is less than 18 months. And so we feel pretty good about our carrying values in that product.
JB Groh – DA Davidson & Co.:
Okay. So, that’s 85% less than – okay, that’s good. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. And I show no further questions or comments at this time, sir.

Operator:
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the AAR Corporation third quarter fiscal 2008 earnings call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce your host for today's presentation Mr. John Bowman, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Bowman, you may begin, sir.
John Bowman:
Thank you, Howard. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining this morning's conference call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that certain of the comments made today relate to future events, which are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release issued last evening, as well as those factors discussed under Item 1A entitled ""Risk Factors"" included in the company's May 31st, 2007 Form 10-K. By providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, David Storch.
David Storch:
Thank you, John, and good morning to everyone. Joining me today is Tim Romenesko, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Rick Poulton, our Chief Financial Officer. Let me begin by saying that we had an exceptional quarter by virtually any measurement or dimension, where we experienced record quarterly sales, net income and earnings per share. Sales grew 39% to $376.6 million and income from continuing operations grew 31% to $20.3 million. Diluted earnings per share were $0.47 for the quarter, which included $0.01 loss per share on the early extinguishment of debt. While acquisitions contributed meaningfully to the results for the quarter, organic sales, which excludes sales growth from acquisitions, grew an impressive 25% year-over-year. If you were to further back out the aircraft sales from both periods our growth rate would have been 19%. We achieved 10.1% operating margins and if you were to back out the effects of the acquisitions and the aircraft sales, margins on our organic business would have been 10.4%. Sales were $151.2 million in the Aviation Supply Chain segment, an increase of 11.5% from last year, and gross margin improved 200 basis points to 24%. Gross profit increased 22% to $36.3 million. During this period, we generated sales from investments made in prior periods, which contributed to double-digit sales increase. Sales of our MRO segment grew 43% in the quarter to $74.8 million. Gross profit increased 53% to $11.1 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 14.9%. Steady performance at our Indianapolis maintenance center and Landing Gear businesses, resulted in market share gains which drove the exceptional sales and earnings growth in this segment. At the conclusion of the quarter, or I should say at the beginning of the new quarter, the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Avborne, which will add a valuable dimension to our MRO position. The business is located at Miami International Airport, a very busy airport, with a high traffic pattern and access to international routes, and rounds out our MRO services by adding wide-body and Airbus capabilities. We look forward to the opportunities this business brings and along these lines just last week, there was an aircraft at MIA that required a return-to-service maintenance, the aircraft was brought over to our facility. And this maintenance required landing gear repair, folks from our Landing Gear operation, about 10 miles away from MIA airport, came over to the airport and provided the repair on the landing gear, while our aircraft maintenance folks worked on the repair to the aircraft. And we're successful putting that aircraft back up into the sky same day. The customer, who is not a current customer of our heavy maintenance operations, was very pleased with the service we performed, and next week our folks would be meeting with this customer to talk about how we can capture more of their maintenance. In the Structures and Systems segment, our organic sales growth rate was 17% fueled by strength in our mobility systems business and the overall sales growth rate in the segment was 75% after the impact of the Brown International and SUMMA acquisitions are included. Gross profit grew 84% to $16.4 million resulting in a gross profit margin of 14.8%. During the quarter, we announced that we signed a lease to occupy 90,000 square feet in McClellan Business Park, formerly McClellan Air Force Base, in Sacramento, California for the manufacture of composite structures and parts and this is an area, where we are seeing increasing demand. We expect the business to come on line during the first quarter of our fiscal 2009. Just to clarify, McClellan Air Force Base was closed as a result of the BRAC Base Realignment Act of 1994, and we have another operation at that air field. They became aware of this opportunity, and we were able to sieze upon it in this quarter. We will have a minimal investment and we expect that to have a very dynamic business out of that facility. Our Aircraft Sales and Leasing segment delivered another strong quarter. As a reminder, results for our Aircraft Sales and Leasing business are reported two ways; first we purchase and sell aircraft for own account results of which flow through our income statement as sales and cost of sales. Second, we enter into aircraft transactions with partners, which are characterized as unconsolidated joint ventures and are reported within the earnings from aircraft joint ventures line our income statement. During the third quarter, operating profit for the segment increased $3.1 million compared to year ago, even though you do see a reduction income on the face of P&L from aircraft joint ventures. The increase in operating profit of the segments reflects a gain from the sale of two of our aircraft from our own account. As of February 29th, we had a total of 37 aircraft, 29 of which are held in joint ventures and 8 of which are held in AARs fully owned portfolio. Furthermore, I would like to comment that as a result of the financial market turmoil, we do expect more opportunities to emerge in this market. SG&A cost for the company increased in the quarter, as a result of the acquisitions and as we continued to invest in our business. However, as a percentage of sales SG&A cost declined to 9% versus 9.1% in the prior year. Net interest expense increased to $6.1 million in the third quarter due to increased average borrowings and lower investment income. In February the company issued 250 million of convertible notes through a private placement. Proceeds after acquiring these associated note hedge and transaction fees were $215 million and were used in parts payoff the outstanding balance and our revolving credit facility, which slightly, largely related to the acquisition of SUMMA and the investments we have made in parts for our Aviation Supply Chain business. In addition during the third quarter the remaining balance of the 2004 convertible notes of $16.4 million were converted to 880,000 shares of our common stock. These shares were already included in our share count. Subsequently, at the end of the third quarter we bought back 13 million of our 8.39% notes due in 2011. As a result of these actions, we expect interest expense to decline in the fourth quarter. In closing I might say that we achieved double-digit sales growth in each of our segments, added a significant dimension to our Structures and Systems business mix, and strengthened our liquidity with recent financing. As we assess risk and seek opportunities like the rest of you, we're paying very close attention to capital market volatility, the economic environment in the United States and abroad, and rising oil prices and their impact on our industry and customer base. With that, I'd like to thank you for participating on the call today, and open up the line for any questions you may have.
Operator:
(Operator Instructions) Our first question or comment comes from the line of Troy Lahr. Mr. Lahr, your line is open.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Company:
Thanks. Structures and Systems had good margins. I guess you're seeing the favorable mix there towards containers. How much longer does that continue forward? Does that run forward next three quarters, four quarters, just give me some insight there?
David Storch:
Yes. The mobility business has a very strong backlog. The mix is favorable. We're continuing to see opportunities for new business for new products. So, we feel good about the prospects. They're both from volume and mix for a while. Whether it's three quarters or nine quarters, I don't know, but the backlog is good for at least another year.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Company:
Okay. Thanks. And then, just that I'm clear you talked a little bit about outsourcing opportunities. We've been kind of waiting for some time to hear other Mesa or Chautauqua size transactions. Is the activity there increasing now that we're kind of getting into a tightening environment, the ongoing negotiation that you've had of this kind of an accelerated with some airlines or just can you update us there a little bit?
David Storch:
I would say that there is a good amount of activity, some large, some medium and some small. And they run the gamut from the various customers we support. So, at this point, I think that the activity level --
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Company:
Has it been kind of accelerating or just kind of been about the same?
David Storch:
I'd say it's about the same. I think there are several opportunities that we're working on out there.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Company:
Okay. And then, just lastly, and then I'll jump back in the queue, can you maybe talk about the composite business that you acquired, how quickly do you think that ramps up, and maybe what markets are you targeting? I mean is this more commercial aerospace or defense type applications for composite work?
Tim Romenesko:
It's not a business we acquired. It's a facility that was fully equipped by the US Air Force back in the '90s for composite manufacturing. So, we are a ""let's see if you will"" of a facility. It's a long-term lease. And as the lease progresses, the equipment inside the facility becomes the property of the company. The opportunities are in the commercial aerospace space, defense, as well as the business jet and general aviation segment. So, it's pretty much across the board. We have, as you know, a composite business already in existence located in Clearwater, Florida. It's been very busy. It's somewhat limited by the number of autoclaves. In this particular lease, we pick up four additional autoclaves, two of which incidentally have never been turned on. So, the reason that we expect to ramp-up in our first quarter, which is beginning in June let's say, is because the facility needs to be reenergized, then reopen basically. So, we see a fair amount of demand, or I should say excessive demand in this area. We have the talent we believe in-house. We've actually hired some additional folks to go ahead and build this into a very productive segment within AAR. To a certain extent, I think one way of looking at this business is very similar to how you might look at Indianapolis for MRO business. I think it's an opportunistic move by the company in an area that appears to be chockfull of demand.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Company:
Okay. Just so I'm clear then, I mean is some of the Clearwater work getting offloaded to this facility or all that work is going to stay at Clearwater?
Tim Romenesko:
No, the work that's in Clearwater will stay in Clearwater, and this will be new work that we will attempt to attract. Now we might get that plan started by shifting some work elsewhere from AAR into the facility, at least, gets off and running. But once we get over the early stages, we do expect to attract new business.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Company:
Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator:
Our next question or comment comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS. Your line is open, sir.
Larry Solow - CJS:
Good morning. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about the impact you're seeing around the major airlines cutting in domestic capacity? Recently Delta have made announcement yesterday. Would this capacity be switched to the international front or how's that going to play, how you think that will play out?
David Storch:
If you take a look at the growth that we've experienced in our Aircraft Sales and Leasing segment, a lot of that growth has come from our ability to acquire aircraft in the US market, and then place those aircraft into international markets. Demand for air travel does not appear to be easing at this point in time. As I indicated in my comments, we are obviously watching this to see what the effects of the US economy might have on domestic travel. So some of the older technology aircraft may be parked, but we do believe that if newer technology aircraft get parked they will be placed elsewhere. We view that as an opportunity both for our aircraft sales and leasing segment, as well as for our supply chain, and pass it our for MRO to put those aircraft back into service with another operator. So, although we believe that you might have some comedown here in North America, we don't believe that worldwide travel or traffic numbers are declining.
Larry Solow - CJS:
Okay. Now then a similar question just looking on the international front, would you say that -- I know we have discussed this before a lot, but with the continuing of the weakening dollar would you expect maybe more opportunities for international airliners to actually be bringing their planes in to North America for work?
David Storch:
We have received some increase along those lines. We've yet to secure any business on the heavy maintenance side. We're hoping that having this Miami business will facilitate that opportunity and but time will tell. At this point in time the exchange rate obviously is favorable on this regard and it might lead to certain opportunities for the company. I would expect this, incidentally more obviously wide bodies than narrow bodies. Narrow bodies don’t have go across the ponds, but we might see some opportunities along these lines. We clearly are seeing some benefits on other businesses from the exchange rate and we are working diligently on the structures and systems business in that regard. Keep in mind, all of our manufacturing capabilities is in North America, so we do see that as a potential opportunity for the company.
Larry Solow - CJS:
Great, and if you could just lastly just discuss a little bit, I believe the SUMMA acquisition if I am not mistaken was like a $100 million annualized revenue. If you could just discuss that and then the Avborne acquisition and how Avborne maybe compares to Indianapolis and I know it is small to say, but I believe the capacity is probably not as small it looks on numbers basis. So if we can just kind of compare with the annualized or potential revenues for those two acquisitions. That will be great.
David Storch:
SUMMA is a very exciting acquisition for the company and that puts another leg on our stool within our Structures and Systems group. Our Structures and Systems group even today consist primarily of the mobility activity, as well as specific manufacturing of products for cargo systems and then we have a composite leg and the SUMMA gives us what we believe is the foundation for an aircraft parts manufacturing piece of our Structures and Systems group. So you are correct in terms of the annualized revenue base. We are hoping to be able to build from that. SUMMA has very good relations, very time-tested relationships with major OEs in the aircraft manufacturing business and we are hoping to capitalize on those and be able to hopefully as result of this move in to McClellan. McClellan will be able to benefit from some of the deep ties SUMMA has with maybe this OEs. So the SUMMA acquisition if you are correct in terms of the size, but I just to want to highlight the fact that it does bring us the potential, that we did not previously have within our Structures and Systems business. So SUMMA is not a bolt-on. SUMMA is kind of adding a leg to our stool. As it relates to Avborne, Avborne is similar in terms of basic fundamental capability within the Indianapolis, other than SUMMA has, I mean Avborne had some success on Airbus airplanes and also wide-body aircraft, the hangars are built in such a way that they can accommodate wide-body aircraft and also Avborne gives us a location that we believe is a very important location as we round out our MRO capability here in North America. So, Avborne is more of a bolt-on than Summa might be, yet Avborne does bring us certain dimensions that we didn’t previously have.
Larry Solow - CJS:
Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator:
Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. Tyler Hojo from Sidoti. Your line is open.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti:
Good morning, guys. I guess this is just a follow-up to that Avborne question. I guess Rick, last conference call you provided kind of an annualized revenue figure for Summa. Would you guys be willing to do that for Avborne?
Rick Poulton:
I think the number there is a little more challenging Tyler because of whether we decide to work narrow-bodies, wide-bodies, etcetera. So, I think we’ll hold back from providing that number now. I think the best thing you could do is you can interpolate a little bit on the square footage base. I think, you also know, what our acquisition prices, and can sort of hone in as a multiple of revenue from that. As we get maybe a firmer mix on where we will with the workload then maybe we will better positioned to give you some better guidance.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti:
That’s fair. And know you provided the square footage for Avborne. What is the current capacity utilization in that facility?
Tim Romenesko:
Tyler, Avborne is busy, there are kind of lot of airplanes coming in out of there. But it is not a nose-to-tail shop like your custom to see in it Indianapolis. So, one of things that we expect to bring in there is maybe not all in place, but we should allocate more of the capacities in nose-to-tail. So, it's very busy, when I was there last week I actually have 15 aircraft around the facility, but some are in there for overnight checks, some are in for two days check, some are in there for 60 days. So, it's little difficult to characterize at the same way you might characterize Indy.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti:
Okay. Thanks for the color, Tim. And just in terms of that kind of your longstanding, longer-term margin target that has been out there 12.5%. I didn't hear you guys kind of reconfirm it. Is that still intact?
Tim Romenesko:
Yes.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti:
Okay, great.
Tim Romenesko:
Yeah, as we make some of these acquisitions, there is, some of these acquisitions have margins below even the 10% that we're looking at and so we have some challenges. Yeah, we view there are many opportunities to go ahead and get margin improvement.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti:
Okay, good. And just a final one, a follow-up to the first questionnaire, just in terms of the supply chain opportunities out there, I think last conference call David you mentioned that your thought something relatively meaningful could hit kind of in the back half for your fiscal year. You still stick in to that or as it maybe pushed a little bit further out to the right or any comments that would be helpful.
David Storch:
Of course, half of that first, second half of the year has gone away. We didn't make any announcement.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti:
Alright.
David Storch:
So, obviously we're now in the last three months. There is a possibility of at least one of these hitting this quarter, but I'd push out some of the balance just based on the -- the overall gestation period I'd push out the balance in to next year, but if I have to say, as you recall last quarter's supply chain we had sales growth of less than 10% there was 8 in change I believe. This quarter we say we will come in above -- against the double-digits we came at 11.5. There is no shortage of opportunities in that business segment and some of them are program related, some are look like programs, but we're not calling them programs, let's put it this way the pace of business is very brisk.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti:
That's fine and actually just one more for you. It look like the MRO segment, the results were terrific there. Actually, one of your competitors came out late last week and they blamed some bad weather in Oklahoma for kind of a revenue miss in their Tulsa facility. Was there any kind of negative impact in the number?
Rick Poulton:
Oh, we definitely saw the bad weather.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti:
Okay.
Rick Poulton:
But no significant impact in our operations.
David Storch:
We didn't have the magnitude that they seem to have had.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti:
Very, good. Thanks.
David Storch:
Let me just reiterate, what you said incidentally that is the growth rate within our MRO segment was truly exceptional 43% growth rate that's all organic I believe it's around as we've talked about before, it's around execution, our MRO team is executing I think beautifully and customers are very satisfied with the work load and looking for AAR to take on more work if we can and I really would like to just congratulate Tim and his team in this regard, because they're doing heck of a job, it's not -- like this business is just hanging up there for somebody to grab and this is you're talking about 43% growth rate in a market that is relatively flat. And my sense is that this is all about our team performing and getting that kind of a growth rate.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti:
Great, thanks.
Operator:
Our next question comes from the line of Jon Braatz. Mr. Braatz, your line is open.
Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital:
Last couple of weeks, we've been hearing some stories in the press about MRO work at Southwest or issues with maintenance operations at Southwest and there is stories in Asia about Asian MRO work. How do you view that? Is that a positive maybe from a long-term standpoint, is the FAA gets a little bit tougher or are there some other issues that might develop that in more paperwork or more work for you guys. But, how do you view all this talk about MRO, I mean, the maintenance work on aircraft both domestically and internationally?
David Storch:
Yeah, the MRO business is a very detailed oriented business, obviously you're talking about safety of flight and we at ARR understand that. We've been in the MRO business through our Oklahoma operation for many years. We are very focus around the detail of the work that we do, having the paperwork, having the training in place as you recall, each of our technicians receives training, pretty much every year, the last three or four years, we've received the Diamond Award from the FAA for having every technician at AAR goes to training. Now, it's a very complex putting the aircraft through a maintenance cycle is a very complex process. In the case of Southwest, managing a fleet as wide as they are is very complex. And I think everybody has pretty much reiterated its safety record as the world’s airlines is truly remarkable. There is a chain, if you will a safety chain. They are the major part of and this is an area that we stay very focused on and pay a lot of attention to the details, and the procedures, and the processes, and the paper work and all that kind of stuff. So, I think if you look at the world that we’re in is a kind of flight-to-quality, then I think quality providers will be in a very good position to benefit. Back here there are some folks who are not necessarily as adept or as detail-oriented as this business requires. So, I feel very good, our head is down if you will, and we’re making certain that we have, we're doing all the things we're supposed to do and we're paying a lot of attention to this segment and it's really no different than we always have. I mean, this is as I said; it’s a very detail-oriented business and you got to pay attention to a lot of different things. And they are from time-to-time, they are slips and the important thing is that the organization has processes in place to capture these slips before they become a problem. So, I believe overall that in the general flight-to-quality lets say, as long as we continue to execute the way we are, we should be a beneficiary.
Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital:
Does the FAA have any, I guess mandate or a power to suggest, that airlines move from one provider to another or is it or kind of the sort of the mandatory type of call on the part of the FAA. So, this MRO provider is not meeting standards, you have to move.
David Storch:
I believe that's within the power of FAA. The FAA has oversight and all of the licensed facilities that carry FAA designation. So they have the ability to monitor on a minutes notice. They have the ability to send staff and teams into facilities that have a certificate. They have the ability to go through their procedures to make sure they are operating within the regulations and if they deem them not to be operating within the regulations, they have the ability to pull their ticket.
Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital:
Okay.
David Storch:
From time-to-time over the years, they have exercised that privilege.
Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital:
Right, okay.
David Storch:
I think in terms of them officially recommending a vendor, one vendor versus another to their customers probably not in their purview. But I mean, you obviously listen when two guys are having a discussion. It probably might not be uncommon for somebody to give an opinion to somebody else and that can always happen.
Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital:
Okay, thank you very much.
David Storch:
Okay.
Operator:
Our next question or comment comes from the line of Alex Hamilton from Jesup & Lamont. Your line is open sir.
Alex Hamilton - Jesup & Lamont:
Hi, good morning. Just, can you provide some sort of color on the sales and leasing market given the liquidity and credit concern? Has there been any change to liquidity, has there been any change to financing rate? That would be appreciated?
David Storch:
Well, that's a complicated question. Let me try to answer this succinctly as I can. Clearly there is obviously at least US, maybe it is international liquidity crunch, which we are very well aware of. We are currently our fleet is fully leased. We have recently actually renegotiated a couple of leases in our favor, where the leases have rolled over and the new rate is at a higher number than the old rate. In terms of the sales of assets in the quarter that we concluded, February 29, we were successful in selling two of our existing aircraft on a cash basis to the buyers who either had the money or financed it. And on the side of availability and I think what we are trying to signal in today's conference call, my comments was that we believe that the liquidity pressures on some of the players will create a certain amount of opportunity. And we are paying very close attention and talking with those who have been publicized to have liquidity problems on owned aircraft and those who might not be publicized but may in fact have liquidity concerns. So we are fairly optimistic in this regard that as a result of some of the liquidity pressure that there will be aircraft opportunities for our aircraft sales and leasing business. Now we are raising our hurdle rate to take into consideration the overall risk environment. So we would anticipate kind of looking out for positive, maybe the option, the last choice let say, because we have to pay very close attention to the acquisition prices that we pay for these assets, keeping in mind our view at least of the risk profile of this market. So all of that -- what I am trying to say in this fashion, as I can say is that we are aware that there are owners of aircraft who have liquidity concerns, problems I should say and we believe we're in a good position to benefit from that.
Alex Hamilton - Jesup & Lamont:
Great. Thank you.
Operator:
Our next question or comment comes from the line of [Stan Mann from EMS]. Your line is open, sir.
Stan Mann - EMS:
First, congratulations on a great quarter. I mean it is fantastic.
David Storch:
Thank you.
Stan Mann - EMS:
I have some couple of detailed questions financial. Can you give us the D&A, the regular D&A going forward and the acquisition D&A going forward. I have a couple of questions I am trying to model?
Rick Poulton:
So D&As for the quarter was $10.4 million which brings you to our year-to-date, right at $30 million, just slightly shy of $30 million.
Stan Mann - EMS:
Okay.
Rick Poulton:
That reflects a full quarter of all the acquisitions we made, other than Avborne, which obviously just closed at the beginning of this quarter. So I think that rate for Q3 is a pretty good run rate, you have got adjust for current CapEx and then later on something for Avborne. I don't have that Avborne right now, but it tends to be the more labor intensive and capital intensive business, so it is...
Stan Mann - EMS:
So it is not major. $1 million or $2 million in the quarter or something like that?
Rick Poulton:
Yeah, the only caveat to that is we do have purchasing accounting to apply to the acquisition that will create some amortization. That wouldn’t otherwise have been in a P&L. So I don't have that number handy. But I mean you could do based on a purchase price and some general allocations you could probably estimate that probably of course easily.
Stan Mann - EMS:
Okay, what about the net debt and the diluted shares going forward?
Rick Poulton:
Diluted shares is something that what you see right now in the current quarter; should not change dramatically. You have a little bit of ups and downs for either stock repurchases on our part or some option exercises or things like that. But that’s pretty minor. It wouldn’t be until we got to a much higher stock price than we're now, that you would see any dilutive effects from the recent convert we get.
Stan Mann - EMS:
Is that 35, is that a 35 area or…?
Rick Poulton:
Little over 35, correct.
Stan Mann - EMS:
And the dilution at that point would be…?
Rick Poulton:
It comes in under a treasury stock method of accounting. So, it’s a function of what the actual stock price is at that time.
Stan Mann - EMS:
Okay.
Rick Poulton:
So, you shouldn’t see any real share change until you get into the $35 plus stock zone and it begins to come in slowly. On the net debt, you see from the press release, what our recourse debt looks like at this juncture. As David mentioned earlier, we did contract to, we entered into a repurchase agreement to buyback some money, some amount of our secured notes. And beyond that it’s a function of what we do with our cash and how we invest in our business. So, I think I am more comfortable telling you that gross debt, you can see that. And then we have a fair amount of cash on hand at the end of the quarter and will deploy that as we see business opportunities.
Stan Mann - EMS:
Okay. Storch does it look like in India as far as buying or utilizing more space?
David Storch:
Do you saying India.
Stan Mann - EMS:
Indianapolis, Indi.
David Storch:
Okay. What's the first item?
Stan Mann - EMS:
Yes, kind of more space and activity etcetera. Are there similar bays that you were talking about.
David Storch:
They are major contributor to the MRO results for the quarter. We are not at full capacity yet and we're getting good use of the space that we are currently occupying. There is some additional space for us to occupy. We are in discussions with the landlord about trying to figure out how to get more space at that airfield one way or another. So, at this point in time that business is strong. The demand is strong. I believe that some of the short-term capacity opportunities that we might see, that we can't handle there, part of our plan is that some outwork would be done down in Miami. So, Indianapolis is strong. We can tell we are seeing some benefits from some of the sideline activities including engineering services. This is an area we highlighted. Stan, you might recall, couple of year back we started to get some traction here this quarter. We hope to build on that key segment of our business as well and sell more of our intellectual property to a customer base who is looking for those kinds of solutions.
Stan Mann - EMS:
Is UAL a leasing agent there, I mean are they the owner of the rest of facility.
David Storch:
No.
Stan Mann - EMS:
So they are not.
David Storch:
No. The owner of the facility and do not hold me to this, this is an airport authority. That is basically backed up by the state of Indiana, the city of Indianapolis and there are some bond holders that obviously have positions now in that facility as well. So, we deal with the airport authority and in fact we are looking right now for ways to even take on more space in the Indianapolis.
Stan Mann - EMS:
Beyond that facility, in addition…
David Storch:
And potentially there is a couple hangars in that facility that we do not control, they are controlled by others.
Stan Mann - EMS:
Okay.
David Storch:
The regional airline...
Stan Mann - EMS:
Okay. The recent announcement of some of the airlines paring, cutting their capacity domestically, is that what’s giving you availability of aircraft to buy and you're leasing and purchase agreements?
David Storch:
We haven't seen that yet. We saw that, we’ve see kind of steady -- that’s going to be steady piece of the business let say, if I go back to '03. So we saw some of the benefits back when the airlines were reducing capacity in the '03, '04, '05 time period. So we made some investment in assets during that time period, which we've been able to place elsewhere. In this current, let say, thrust we have not seen serviceable airplanes that hit the market. We have seen airplanes for disassembly that hit the market and we have procured some of those in prior periods.
Stan Mann - EMS:
So the opportunities you're seeing are taking it on from the existing leasing companies because we -- AAR is more liquid and stronger than the current leasing agents?
David Storch:
I think then that was part of the strategy behind our offering in February was to get us additional liquidity and put us in a stronger position to the benefit from this movement and I think the results are bearing out. Clearly, these markets are not growing at the growth rate that this company is achieving. So, we think we are in a unique position. Our niche continues to expand. We're looking at different opportunities in this regard, and I think having a strong balance sheet obviously position us to take advantage of those opportunities. But at the same token, we're trying to do thing that don't require balance sheet. I mean the Indianapolis business, we have very small investments in Indianapolis yet, it's a major contributor today to our growth rate both sales and earnings. And I singled earlier about the moving to McClellan Air Force Base and also is a very minimal investment on our part, because we have a strong balance sheet, sometime when you have a strong balance sheet, you don't need to use it to go ahead and get some opportunities. So, I think that's part of our strategy as well.
Stan Mann - EMS:
Right, the last question is; do we have anything going on in Asia as far as MRO?
Tim Romenesko:
We have a landing gear venture in Malaysia.
Stan Mann - EMS:
Right.
Tim Romenesko:
That is, just coming into its own more or less not fully online, it's more or less today, more of a store front that eventually will be a full service repair facility. But no other than that stand at this moment, we do not have other physical facilities in that region. We do have sales offices throughout Asia that are managing the relationships with different Asian accounts and, but for the most part we are servicing those customers from our North American facilities.
Stan Mann - EMS:
But that could be a stepping stone, a fiscal stepping stone into Asia?
Tim Romenesko:
In time, we need to have more Asian content; more Asian mix in our business and it's something we're focused on with the weak the flip side to the weak dollar is the inability to move into some of these markets advantageously. So, for today at least, we're able to get some growth servicing these businesses from North America. But long-term, you're correct the company is going to need more capability in that region.
Stan Mann - EMS:
Okay. Good job. Thank you.
Tim Romenesko:
Thank you.
Operator:
Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. J.B. Groh. Mr. Groh, your line is open, sir.
J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.:
Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I popped on late, so if you addressed this just differ and I'll dig it out of the transcript, but you adjusted lease rates a little bit. Could you maybe talk about trends there, do you still see those going up holding firm, you mentioned one renewal that you had that was at a higher rate, but could you maybe make more general comments there on overall lease rates?
David Storch:
My sense is that with all of the stuff going on in the world today, that lease rates will probably stay fairly steady to where they are today. Some of the opportunities that we've recently experienced are from aircraft leases, maybe three to five years old and they were rolling over and keep in mind, five year ago lease was in the depths of a kind of aerospace recession or whatever you want call it and lease rates were historically at very low levels. So, you're seeing some reset in that regard, coming out of that '03, '04 time period, maybe even '05 and as those mature and turnover I should say, the lease rates are more attractive. But I think from this point forward, I believe that the lease rates ones they, ones you're come off the bottom of that period, I just identified. I think the lease rates stay fairly constant. Now, that's assuming that things stay relatively constant. So, if things where to get worse again, and you'd see a reduction in lease rates. But I think for right now, the aircraft are in short supply worldwide at this point of time, and the more efficient the aircraft is, the more in demand the aircraft is, so we've been focused on more efficient aircraft and making sure that we can keep those aircraft out with good credits and so far we've been pretty successful in that regard.
J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.:
So, what are you saying is old lease rates rolling over you probably get a positive bump up, but as far as current rates are going, you look those to be steady and maybe you've got the fuel headwind that's probably causing those rates to the sort of stay in the same range they're now?
David Storch:
I think that pretty much says it.
J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.:
And maybe you can talk about your the market for used aircraft and I'd assume that moves not a lock step, but same sort of trend as maybe the overall commercial production and what your strategy is there, I mean I'm guessing that it's A320 family, 737NG type acquisitions.
David Storch:
Yeah, I think we haven't yet moved into the NG arena. We are looking today at opportunities in that market, but yeah, the A320 is something we're trafficking in and most of our activity has been in the 737 Classic family, like for instance the acquisition of 18 aircraft from Malaysian Airline system those were 737-400 that were 1992 to 1997 vintage aircraft. And so if you look at the majority of our portfolio would be in that vintage, yet there is a movement for us at least to move that a little bit more current, if you will.
J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.:
What's the average lease period that you have on the books?
David Storch:
The average lease of, the kinds of deals that we're entering are mostly in the three to five year range and we do from time-to-time. We are acquiring, looking at aircraft that have longer lease period, maybe coming off of some of the 20 year, 25, 20 year leases, where we come in after the 50 year or something like that. So, but I'd say generally speaking the lease rates for the aircraft that we are trafficking in are in the 3 to 5 year range.
J.B. Groh - DA. Davidson & Co.:
Great, hey thank you for your time and congratulations on the quarter.
David Storch:
Thank you.
Operator:
Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. [David Ratlis from Dulcet Company]. Your line is open, sir. Mr. Ratlis you may need to un-mute your phone, sir. Okay, we will return him to the queue. Our next question or comment is from Mr. Eric Hugel from Stephens. Your line is open sir.
Eric Hugel - Stephen:
Good morning guys. Good quarter.
David Storch:
Thank you.
Eric Hugel - Stephens:
Hey, can you talk about, I know in the past Dave you talked about the Aviation Supply Chain margin sort of typically bouncing around in the 22 to 24 range, for now this is like the second quarter in a row that we've been at the 24 or sort of a high end of that range, is there something sort of structurally that you've changed, you've improved in this business or are we susceptible to sort of those numbers dropping back down?
David Storch:
Well, we have a leading position in this market. We've been in this business since our founding. So, we understand the aircraft parts market as well as anybody else in the business. We've been able to benefit from our strong balance sheet position. We talked about back in the second quarter in particular, where we acquired fair amount of inventory and that inventory has starting to flow through our system. We have meaningful sales coming out of the investments we've made in the second quarter. We continue to make investments in the third quarter and we've even continue to make investments in the fourth quarter in this business. So, I believe that we've been able to make pretty attractive acquisitions of equipment, and I think you are seeing some of that benefit there in the margin. So how long that sustains itself is a tough question. We're very pleased with the performance of that group and the 24, you are correct, is the upper end to the margins, yet there are still some elements to that business. Our component repair shops, for instance, there are some opportunities there to improve performance. We recently announced a contract for some Army helicopter component repair that should contribute to improved margins in that business. But I think on balance, I think you pretty well said it. I think that we can fluctuate between that 22 and 24. We're running at the high end. How long it stays at 24, I can't really say. We haven't seen a change in trends, but it doesn't mean that there can't be circumstance or situations that may cause that to dip down.
Eric Hugel - Stephen:
Okay. Fair enough. Can you talk about, I guess, in terms of your overall operating margin number, I mean you are at that now for a second quarter in a row. You've achieved that 10% sort of target that you had set out. You've got Summa now in the mix, and I'm assuming that there was some nice purchase accounting associated with that in this quarter, yet you still maintain that. You got Avborne coming online. I mean, is it your expectation that with some of these headwinds coming out, I guess, additional purchase accounting that you'd be able to maintain that 10% operating margin going forward?
David Storch:
Yeah. Listen, as we make these acquisitions, they've been a little bit of a drag on the margins. So, as we try to normalize the business, my opening comments that the sales growth was 39% if you back out the acquisition. So if you just looked organically, sales growth was 25%, and then if you back out the year-over-year aircraft transactions, sales growth was 19%. We reported 10.1% operating margin, but if you backed out the acquisitions and you backed out the aircraft transactions, operating margins would have been 10.4%. So, the acquisitions we've made have been a little bit of a drag on operating margins for some of the some reasons that you identified. And over time, as we integrate these businesses, it would be our goal to see the operating, these be contributors to our operating margin business. It might be a little tougher for the Avborne business because, by nature, the MRO business has tougher operating margins. But also keep in mind, there is less investments in those business. So, return on capital has been a better measurement for the MRO businesses. Nevertheless, we would expect Tim has numerous initiatives going on around the company. We have lean initiatives in our Indianapolis business, in our landing gear business, in our components shops in New York, and hopefully, eventually in Amsterdam. So, we were looking for ways to drive efficiency through the company. Going back to the performance, goals of the company, we recognize that the growth that we're getting today is largely, we believe, due to taking market share and we're taking that market share because we're performing. We're performing for the customer, but we also recognize, we need to perform for the shareholder. So, in that process we hope to continue down that path of getting to that 12.5% target. It will be, it goes in is and goes out is, and as we absorb these acquisitions at first blush they are a drag, and then, hopefully, we're able to execute and get these margins going in the right direction.
Eric Hugel - Stephen:
With regards to Summa, was there a significant amount of inventory step up that hit you this quarter that would pretty much washout during this quarter and you wouldn't have that headwind going forward?
David Storch:
No, Eric, nothing that is isolated on a quarter.
Eric Hugel - Stephen:
Okay. With regards to Southwest, I guess in the mix of all of these sort of maintenance troubles that they are sort of going through, one of the interesting things that they sort of announced was that they were planning on moving four lines of maintenance to El Salvador, which now they've shelved those plans, and they said all those lines were outsourced in the US to providers. One, were any of those sort of planned lines of maintenance, anything that you guys are doing with them at Indy? And two, are there potential discussion or is there an opportunity that you potentially see now that they are killing those plans to outsource those lines to El Salvador they're going to keep them domestic to get some more additional business there?
Tim Romenesko:
So, Eric, the lines that were going to go were not coming out of Indy. Southwest is good customer and we're working with them everyway we can to support them. We've helped them get some of their aircraft back to service, and we're constantly talking to them about ways to be more helpful.
Eric Hugel - Stephen:
The Southwest issues in terms of their maintenance lapses and check, that's all internal to Southwest. That does noting do with third party MRO providers, does it?
Tim Romenesko:
Correct.
Eric Hugel - Stephen:
Okay.
Tim Romenesko:
As David mentioned, it's largely around the paperwork.
Eric Hugel - Stephen:
Okay. Also, United, they are a sizeable customer at Indy. They're talking about taking 15 to 20 aircraft out of the mix. They're talking about older domestic aircraft, which to me means their 737s, 300s and 500s, their oldest aircraft in the fleet domestic and you are the exclusive provider of all that maintenance. Are there plans right now, are you in discussions about reducing the number of lines, and then you would have to fill in some additional lines? I know they are flying about 95 37's right now. So reducing 15 to 20 is not the end of world, but is there a potential here that as we get into the back half of the year that you're going to see a line reduction?
Tim Romenesko:
There is always a potential. But right now that's not the nature of the conversations we're having with United. So we're prepared for that if that were to happen, but that's not what we're hearing.
Eric Hugel - Stephen:
Okay. Tim, can give us an update on where things stand with the component repair business and getting those margins up? I mean we've been, I guess, slower than hoped for, for the last couple of quarters on the trek up from breakeven up to high single digit operating margins. Can you give us sort of a trend of where things are and how much far that we have to go?
Rick Poulton:
David has touched on it in his comments. We've got a good start in that. We've won some business recently, some meaningful business. And I think you probably saw that release. We've strengthened the leadership of that business recently that we think is also going to have an impact. We're investing in some process improvement initiative there. So, as David said, I think there is still plenty of upside there but we are starting at the early stages of seeing some improvement.
Eric Hugel - Stephen:
Would you say that right now, that sort of business in terms of operating margin is mid single-digit?
Rick Poulton:
Yes.
Eric Hugel - Stephen:
Okay, great. And then the lastly, just sort of a numbers question, give CapEx for the quarter?
Rick Poulton:
Eric, I say mid single-digit or about.
Eric Hugel - Stephen:
Okay.
Rick Poulton:
CapEx Eric is just under $80 million for the quarter.
Eric Hugel - Stephen:
Great. Thanks a lot guys, good quarter.
Rick Poulton:
Thanks.
Operator:
(Operator Instruction) We have a follow-up from Troy Lahr from Stifel. Your line is open, sir.
Troy Lahr - Stifel:
Thanks. Just a follow-up question on Indi, you guys talked a lot about still seeing good customer interest there looking to expand the facility. How is the labor market been there? Have you seen improvements there?
David Storch:
I'd say modest improvements, but still I'd say relatively tight.
Troy Lahr - Stifel:
Okay. So are wage rates still pretty higher now or have you seen wage rates come down a little bit?
David Storch:
Well, that's so much around the wages I wouldn't say, wages have not come down. I think it's an industry-wide maybe even beyond industry-wide problem getting attracting skilled technical labor.
Troy Lahr - Stifel:
Okay.
David Storch:
Certainly not unique to Indianapolis.
Troy Lahr - Stifel:
Sure. Okay. And then regarding SUMMA Technology, the integration, are you fully done with the integration or can you just maybe update us on that? Did you see any surprises, once you actually acquired the business, kind of maybe what you experienced with Rev Air bear how it cost you a little more to integrate some of that, anything going on like that in SUMMA?
David Storch:
I think the integration has gone quite well. There has been some real solid positive that we have seen and really not any significant negatives.
Tim Romenesko:
Troy, I would just add to that as David said, it's a additional leg on the stool, so the level of integration I think it's fair to say was a lot lower than it would been at Hot Springs acquisition.
Troy Lahr - Stifel:
Okay. And then lastly at the MRO business, I guess couple of quarters ago, you had some problem aircraft contracts comes through, some problem aircraft. Any more of that do you think that's a kind of behind you and kind of understand what have been and you are on the same page with the customer now about what aircraft coming through your facilities?
Tim Romenesko:
Yes.
Troy Lahr - Stifel:
Can you elaborate or just--?
Tim Romenesko:
No, I mean those issues are well behind us. I think they were a point in time a couple quarters ago and we are not experiencing those difficulties with those airplanes.
Troy Lahr - Stifel:
Okay. Are you reworking any additional MRO contracts trying to get better pricing on any of those? I think you went though that in the past on one contract, just wondered is that ongoing?
Tim Romenesko:
There is no specific contract kind of contract renegotiation going on. As we look at Avborne and bring on new customers, but I don't think is there anything going on right now in terms of renegotiating the contracts.
Troy Lahr - Stifel:
Okay, thanks guys.
Operator:
Our next question or comment is a follow-up from Mr. Tyler Hojo. Your line is open sir.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company:
Two quick follow-up. Just in regards to the Indianapolis facility, how many bays are you currently utilizing?
David Storch:
Tyler, it changes fairly frequently, but I think at last count we were booking out of eight bays. And we're getting ready to bring the paint bay on as well.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company:
Okay. Great. And lastly, just in terms to your aircraft portfolio, I believe the last time you commented just in terms of the number of aircraft purchase pre-9/11 was the first quarter when there were six. How many are on the books as of today?
David Storch:
Three. I didn't hear -- the question is on the pre-9/11 aircrafts on the books, three.
Tyler Hojo - Sidoti & Company:
Three? Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator:
Our next question or comment comes from Arnie Ursaner from CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities:
Hi, good morning. Two very quick questions. One is on the cash that you have on your balance sheet, can you give us a feel for if you have any exposure auction rate notes and what sort of rates you're getting on the cash.
Tim Romenesko:
No auction rate notes.
David Storch:
No exposure, Arnie, and what earnings on that cash, you know, somewhere between 300 and 375 bips.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities:
Okay. And just to be clear, on Southwest did you receive any emergency repair work on this recent announcement, and if so, did it displace other work that you already had in hand?
David Storch:
Arnie, we helped Southwest in some of their outstations doing remote overnight inspections, so it didn't displace anything.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities:
But if you did work in their sites, you had to obviously take some of your key personnel to their site to do it?
David Storch:
It was not disruptive to our operations in any way.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities:
Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator:
Our final question will be from Mr. Larry Solow. Mr. Solow, your line is open.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
Just one real quickie, any update on the Airbus A400 contract and is there any potential to see revenues in calendar 2008?
David Storch:
It looks like it's going to be early '09, Larry, when deliveries begin. We're continuing to work with our prime contractor and with Airbus to get the cargo system design finalized and the manufacturing ramped up. So it looks like it's going to be early '09 when it starts to impact revenue throughout.
Larry Solow - CJS Securities:
Great, okay. Thanks.
Operator:
Gentlemen, we have no additional questions or comments in the queue at this time.
David Storch:
Okay. Well, thank you very much for participating and hopefully we were helpful here today, so have a nice day. Bye-bye.
Operator:
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day."
